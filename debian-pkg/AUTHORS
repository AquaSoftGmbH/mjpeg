Included in this package are also slightly modified versions of:

quicktime4linux	by Adam Williams
jpeg libraries and utilities version 6b by the independent JPEG group.

Please *do not* contact the respective authors regarding issues with the
included versions of these packages.  They are modified and are quite
likely now out-of-date.  If you wish to use these packages you almost
certainly want to the use the originals rather than the hacked versions here.

The necessity for these modified versions will in any case disappear
shortly.
