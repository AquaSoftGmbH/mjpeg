1.	mpeg2enc has only been tested cursorarily on MPEG-2 streams.
	I have no easy way of testing them and they take forever to
	encode...


2.      VCD multiplexing is currently subtly broken.  Calculated data-rates
	in mplex are too tight (probably not leaving enough head-room for
	the system stream overhead).

3.	You can't current easily steal your friend's Windows Athlon
	for your evil purposes 	using cygwin32 as the quicktime lib
	demands pthreads.


4.	Bit-rate control in the encoder is currently a little too loose.
	The current code is a comprise approximation between compressing
	un-necessarily hard after a number of frames have under-shot their
	target and guaranteeing never to exceed the target bit-rate.

	Eventually new code based on monitoring the VBV state will give accurate	results.

	The current problem is compounded by a somewhat naive method of 
	calculating necessary bit-rate in the multiplexer.
