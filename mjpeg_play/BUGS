1.	mpeg2enc has only been tested cursorarily on MPEG-2 streams.
	It was hard enough to make sure the MPEG-1 stuff worked really
	reliably ;-).  Last test seemed to suggest recent improvements in the
	motion compensation code have *broken* MPEG2 encoding. Don't worry
	its next on the list for work!

2.  The bit-rate control algorithm in mpeg2enc is relatively new and must
	therefore be regarded with some suspicion.  It *looks* to have corrected
	some annoying problems with overshoots in earlier versions and
	poor handling of unusually active blocks but I'd want more evidence...

3.	The lacplay / xlav apps fail rather than automatically switch to software
	decoding if no MJPEG hardware is present.

4.	At least for my install of SDL software playback MJPEG function sizes
	its window inconsistently with what it claims it is going to do.
	Playback speed

5.  The option for switching to a high-res DCT matrix is broken (segfaults) in
	mpeg2enc is broken.

6.	Variable bit-rate (fixed quantisation) mode in mpeg2enc is currently not
	really useable since the VBV buffer code and a few bits and pieces in
	the rate control code do not yet have the necessary code to handle
	it correctly. The headers of the produced MPEG must also be
	regarded as "probably wrong".

7.	The sourcecode needs to be updated a little to permit the full use of the
	autoconf scriptology.  E.g. You can't not include libmovtar because the
	#ifdef-ing isn't quite right and some movtar only stuff is referred to in
	places compiled when libmovtar isn't present.
