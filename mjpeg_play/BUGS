1.	mpeg2enc has only been tested cursorarily on MPEG-2 streams.
	It was hard enough to make sure the MPEG-1 stuff worked really
	reliably ;-)

2.  The bit-rate control algorithm in mpeg2enc is relatively new and must
	therefore be regarded with some suspicion.  It *looks* to have corrected
	some annoying problems with overshoots in the pre-release version and
	poor handling of unusually active blocks but I'd want more evidence...

4.	At least for my install of SDL software playback MJPEG function sizes
	its window inconsistently with what it claims it is going to do.
	Playback speed

5.  The option for switching to a high-res DCT matrix is broken (segfaults) in
	mpeg2enc is broken.
