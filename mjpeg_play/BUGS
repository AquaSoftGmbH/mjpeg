1.	mpeg2enc has only been tested cursorarily on MPEG-2 streams.
	It was hard enough to make sure the MPEG-1 stuff worked really
	reliably ;-). Progressive sequences seem o.k. but field sequences
	need work on the MC selection code.

2.  The bit-rate control algorithm in mpeg2enc is relatively new and must
	therefore be regarded with some suspicion.  It *looks* to have corrected
	some annoying problems with overshoots in earlier versions and
	poor handling of unusually active blocks but I'd want more evidence...

3.	The lavplay / xlav apps fail rather than automatically switch to software
	decoding if no MJPEG hardware is present.

4.	At least for my install of SDL software playback MJPEG function sizes
	its window inconsistently with what it claims it is going to do.
	Playback speed

6.	The VBVbuffer delay code is hopeless broken.  It is currently turned off
	and needs re-implementing from scratch.  Not urgent though since no
	decoder ever seems to take any notice of it.  Certainly I never figured
	out the the damn thing would be useful for once your mux-er has
	checked for /ensured video buffer size bounding.


7.	The sourcecode needs to be updated a little to permit the full use of the
	autoconf scriptology.  E.g. You can't not include libmovtar because the
	#ifdef-ing isn't quite right and some movtar only stuff is referred to in
	places compiled when libmovtar isn't present.
