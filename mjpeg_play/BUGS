1.	MPEG2 support for progressive sequences frame (-F 0) and  
	field-interlaced (-F 3) is now well tested.  Field
	sequences (-F 1 and -F 2) appear to be working but aren't yet thoroughly
	tested and lack some recent optimisations available for
	progressive sequences.  Mplex *DOES NOT* support field -F 1 and -F 2 
	streams.

2.	At least for my install of SDL software playback MJPEG function sizes
	its window inconsistently with what it claims it is going to do.
	Playback speed

3.  There are probably some minor issues relating to capture sizing when
	capturing using the Matrox hardware.

4.	The VBVbuffer delay code is hopeless broken.  It is currently turned off
	and needs re-implementing from scratch.  Not urgent though since
	no decoder ever seems to take any notice of it.  Certainly I never
	figured out the the damn thing would be useful for once your
	mux-er has	checked for /ensured video buffer size bounding.


5.	mpeg2enc is currently broken for 422 and 444 video.   The problem is that
	the calculations for checking chrominance in the the motion compensation
	search assume 2-pel sub-sampled U and V in X and Y.
