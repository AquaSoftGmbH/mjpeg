	* Created intial automake & autoconf files (still lot of bugs, I
	guess ;) )

	* Created libmovtar (read/write support not complete yet)

	* Created libmjpeg

2000-12-07


	* Initial support for Software-only mjpeg playback.

	* Seperated mpeg encoding tools from tools used to extract raw
	audio/video from mjpeg.

	* Initial support for transcoding using patched mpeg2dec and
	ac3dec packages.

	* Further speed and quality improvements to MPEG-1 encoding with
	mpeg2enc. Bugs fixed. Run-time selection of MMX/extended
	MMX/SSE/3D-Now! routines as appropriate.

	* mplex now much faster, debugged, and supports correct VCD
	compatible multiplexing and splitting of streams into multiple files.
	Initial MPEG-2 video support.  Supports layer 3 audio and (hopefully)
	MPEG audio V2 and V2.5 though these don't look too useful...
