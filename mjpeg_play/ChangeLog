	guess ;) )

	* Created libmovtar (read/write support not complete yet)

2000-12-07 Andrew Stevens (as@comlab.ox.ac.uk)

	* 1.3b2 release.  Tag: 1_3Beta2

	* Initial support for Software-only mjpeg playback.

	* Seperated mpeg encoding tools from tools used to extract raw
	audio/video from mjpeg.

	* Initial support for transcoding using patched mpeg2dec and
	ac3dec packages.

	* Further speed and quality improvements to MPEG-1 encoding with
	mpeg2enc. Bugs fixed. Run-time selection of MMX/extended
	MMX/SSE/3D-Now! routines as appropriate.

	* mplex now much faster, debugged, and supports correct VCD
	compatible multiplexing and splitting of streams into multiple files.
	Initial MPEG-2 video support.  Supports layer 3 audio and (hopefully)
	MPEG audio V2 and V2.5 though these don't look too useful...

        * Bug fixes and support for software-only playback of mjpeg.

Revision 1.5  2000/12/15 19:34:09  wackston
MPEG-2 encoding has been restored to working order. Still some doubts about
whether its 100% correct again but as far as I can tell any remaining bugs are just sub-optimality rather than crass errors.

mplex now support MPEG-2 mux-ing *and* layer 3 audio.
