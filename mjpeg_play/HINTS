(0)  Read the README's.  There's a lot of useful info buried in there...

(1) If you want to play on hardware decoders don't build variable
bit-rate video streams.  If you intend to use software players they're
a *much* better bet.  The variable bit-rate support in "mplex" is new
so there could be bugs.  Let us know!
	 
	 Buffer sizes.  For hardware players experimentation is the order
	 of the day.  My DXR2 seems to use a nice big > 100K buffer for
	 VCD as well as DVD streams and be happy too read MPEG-1 streams
	 *much* faster than the official VCD 170K/sec.  300K seems fine.
	 
	 Generally, given the current slightly lame rate control code in
	 mpeg2enc you'll probably need a buffer size of around 1/4
	 data-rate to avoid buffer underflows (signalled
	 as "time out"'s by mplex).
	 
(2)  If you want to play MPEG-1 stuff on hardware decoders stick to
     44.1 Stereo layer-2 audio.   

(3)  Use the noise filters when MPEG compressing broadcast material
     unless it is *very* good or you like Artefacts.   Use a motion
     compensation search setting around 15 or 20.  It is, I believe,
     currently possible to set motion compensation search too
     high.  You'll get warnings about violating the MPEG-1 standard.

(4) If you want to compress MPEG-2: feel free to try it, however, its
	not tested.  Fully tested version coming next...

(5) Storing MPEG's.  If you record the data as XA mode 2 tracks you
	can fit appreciably more on a CD (at the expense of error
	correction/detection).  You need to slightly hack mkvcdfs or vcdimager
	to stop them prepending/appending lots of null sectors if you use them
	to do this.  I'll try to incorporate suitable patches through their
	developers before you read this!
 
(6) For encoding a typical (45 minute runnig time) show to 90 odd
minute movie from an analog broadcastI have found a CBR bit-rate of
2200 to be ideal.  The resulting files are around 700M for 45 minutes
which fits nicely as a raw XA MODE2 data track on a CD-R.  (I use
cdrdao to write such CD's and a hacked version of vcdread - soon to be
included to extract them).

(7) For transcoding existing MPEG-2 streams a much lower data-rate
than for broadcast analog will give good results. Standard VCD 1152
Kbps works fine.  The difference is in the Signal/Noise ratio of the
original.  The noise in the analog stuff makes it much harder to
compress.
