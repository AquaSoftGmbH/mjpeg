(1)  If you want to play on hardware decoders don't build variable bit-rate video streams.
	 If you intend to use software players they're a *much* better bet.  The variable
	 bit-rate support in "mplex" is new so there could be bugs.  Let us know!
	 
	 Buffer sizes.  For hardware players experimentation is the order of the day.  My
	 DXR2 seems to use a nice big > 100K buffer for VCD as well as DVD streams and be happy
	 too read MPEG-1 streams *much* faster than the official VCD 170K/sec.  300K seems fine.
	 
	 Generally, given the current slightly lame rate control code in mpeg2enc you'll probably
	 need a buffer size of around 1/4 data-rate to avoid buffer underflows (siginalled
	 as "time out"'s by mplex).
	 
(2)  If you want to play MPEG-1 stuff on hardware decoders stick to
     44.1 Stereo layer-2 audio.   

(3)  Use the noise filters when MPEG compressing broadcast material
     unless it is *very* good or you like Artefacts.   Use a motion
     compensation search setting around 15 or 20.
     It is, I believe, currently possible to set motion compensation search too
     high.  You'll get warnings about violating the MPEG-1 standard.

(4)  If you want to compress MPEG-2: feel free to try it, however, as far as I
	am aware mplex won't multiplex MPEG-2 correctly.  Coming soon...

(5)  If you want to compress MPEG-1: buy reasonably fast CPU's.
	 Currently my Celeron-366and K6-2-500 run at about 1/4 playing-time.  My PIII-450's
	 around 1/3 playing time. I expect Coppermine and  Athlon based CPU's will 
	 *fly* on this work.
	 
(6)	For encoding a typical (45 minute running time) show to 90 odd minute movie I have found
	a CBR bit-rate of 2400 to be ideal.  The resulting files are around 700M for 45 minutes
	which fits nicely as a raw XA MODE2 data track on a CD-R.  (I use cdrdao to write such CD's
	and a hacked version of vcdread - soon to be included to extract them).
