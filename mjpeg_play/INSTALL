Linux MPEG/MJPEG Audio/Video tools - MJPEG TOOLS
================================================

The mjpegtools are a set of utilities for video-decoding, -recording,
-playback, -editing and -encoding. Most parts of this software are
distributed under the terms of the Gnu Public License (GPL). See
the individual source files for the exact terms. We are known to
install on Linux, BSD and IRIX. On other systems, you are on yor own,
but maybe you're lucky.

REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED SOFTWARE
=============================
For compiling the mjpegtools, you will at least need the following
pieces of software:

glib           : http://www.gtk.org/
(g)cc/g++/c++  : http://gcc.gnu.org/ 
libjpeg        : http://www.ijg.org/
XFree86        : http://www.xfree86.org/
(x86 only) nasm: http://nasm.2y.net/

These are almost always included with every distribution by default.

However, with this, many of the tools and many features of the tools
will not be compiled by default. The following software is advised
for getting the extra features of the mjpegtools:

Avifile        : http://avifile.sourceforge.net/
Gtk+           : http://www.gtk.org/
libDV          : http://libdv.sourceforge.net/
SDL            : http://www.libsdl.org/

Some of these are not installed with default distributions. If any
of them is not found, you will find out after the ./configure process.

COMPILING SUPPORT LIBRARIES
===========================
The following libraries are strongly recommended for compiling
the mjpegtools:

JPEG-MMX
libmovtar
quicktime4linux

You can download each of them at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpeg/

The JPEG-MMX only compiles on a x86 architecture. If you have a Power PC or
something else, you cannot use the JPEG-MMX compile will fail with a
SIMD_ALIGN meassage ore something like this. You have to use the standart
jpeg libary instead. 

First, install JPEG-MMX, simply unpack, './configure' and 'make'.
Do *not* run 'make install'! Next, unpack libmovtar and run
'./configure --with-jpeg-mmx=/path/to/jpeg-mmx, where /path/to/jpeg-mmx
is the directory where you just compiled JPEG-MMX. Next, run 'make'
and 'make install'. Lastly, unpack quicktime4linux and run
'./configure' and 'make'. Do *not* run 'make install'!

COMPILING THE MJPEGTOOLS
========================
Unpack the tarball and run './configure --with-jpeg-mmx=/path/to/jpeg-mmx
--with-quicktime=/path/to/quicktime4linux', where /path/to/jpeg-mmx
and /path/to/quicktime4linux are the directories where you just
compiled JPEG-MMX and quicktime4linux. You can possibly use other
options, such as '--enable-cmov-extensions' or '--enable-large-file' to
enable CMOV CPU extensions or > 2GB file support. Please note that
CMOV-binaries will *not* run on CPUs that lack CMOV support! Binaries
compiled with large file support will *not* run on systems lacking
large file support! Next, run 'make' and 'make install'. You're now ready
to use the mjpegtools! The MJPEG HOWTO (mjpeg_howto.txt or 'man
mjpegtools') is probably a good place to start.
