Linux Audio/Video tools - LAVTOOLS
==================================

The lavtools stand for "Linux/Audio video tools" and are released
under the General GNU Public Licence, see the COPYING file for
details.

Required Software
-----------------


*** Software you *must* have installed

1) Quicktime4Linux 1.2.0 - http://heroine.linuxave.net/quicktime.html

The configure scripts look for this in /usr/local/src/quicktime by default.
You can specify another directory using the --with-quicktime flag to
the ./configure script.

N.b. it would seem that quicktime-1.2 is a little picky about the
compilers it is built under.  You may get complaints about missing
functions.  If so you need to try a more up-to-date gcc or egcs or an
older quicktime library that doesn't include the offending code
(support for digital video that makes heavy use of inline's). If this
is the case a hacked version of Q4L can be found where you found this.
Furthermore, in its original form the Quicktime library includes a
built-in jpeg library.  This prevents full use being made of the
somewhat faster MMX version available (see 2. below).  It is easy to
hack out the jpeg stuff but if you don't fancy that you can use a
pre-hacked version downloadable from where you got this package.

The file is called "quicktime4linux-1.2njpg.tar.gz"

Either way: compile and install/

2) The MMX enhanced jpeg library from the same place you got this package.

O.k. actually, you *don't* need this.libjpeg6 (libjpeg6a or 6b is
included in the standard distributions) along with the corresponding
"jpegint.h" header file from the source code wiil do. This header file
is needed so that the colour-space conversion routines to be used by
the jpeg library can be correctly set for the state of the X display.

However, by far the simplest solution is to the faster patched MMX
version that can be found with where you obtained this software.  The
file is called:

"jpeg-mxx-0.1.1.tar.gz"

It is *strongly* recommended you compile and install this.  Don't
worry about it messing up your precious system jpeg libs.  Its default
settings (which are those expected by the scripts for lavtools)
install only simple static libraries in /usr/local named jpeg-mmx to
prevent clashes.

3) The libmovtar library for handling audio/video streams in "movtar" format.
Very handy for hacking around, moving between formats, and experimentation.

The file is called: "libmovtar-0.1.1.tar.gz".

Compile and install.



3) The GLib library - http://www.gtk.org
(libglib .... is included in the standard distributions)

4) The SDL library -  http://www.libsdl.org/
   I used SDL 1.1.6 for development, please tell me if the 
   new SDL versions won't compile with this software ! 

	Some rather tricky and difficult to repeat problems centred around the
	use of pre-compiled versions of this library.  If software
	playback crashes out on you immediately try compiling and
	installing SDL from source-code.

*** Software you'll find useful


1) The "toolame" MP2 encoder and the "sox" audio processing tool.

A remark regarding RPM packages: If you want to install RPM packages
instead, always keep in mind that you need to install the developer
versions.

(www.freshmeat.net is also a good source for all kind of Linux soft !)


To build the package just type :

./configure 
make

Then (with root privileges if needed) :

make install

If you have installed Quicktime4Linux and/or the jpeg libraries in unusual places you may need to use some options to persuade ./configure to find them.

You should now be able to run the lavtools and MPEG compressors at least.

Have a look at the README to see how the lavtools (ought to ;) ) work ...
