Linux Audio/Video tools - LAVTOOLS
==================================

The lavtools stand for "Linux/Audio video tools" and are released
under the General GNU Public Licence, see the COPYING file for
details.

Installation:
-------------

Please see REQUIRED_SOFTWARE to find out which software you will need to compile and install this package.

To build the package just type :

./configure 
make

Then (with root privileges if needed) :

make install

If you have installed Quicktime4Linux and/or the jpeg libraries in unusual places you may need to use some options to persuade ./configure to find them.

You should now be able to run the lavtools and MPEG compressors at least.

Have a look at the README to see how the lavtools (ought to ;) ) work ...
