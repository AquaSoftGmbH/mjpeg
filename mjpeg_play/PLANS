(Gernot Ziegler speaking)
These are some of my new ideas, I don't know if I am going to realize them - ever:

for the movtar directory:

.) movtar_avi, movtar_setinfo

.) Plugins for GIMP

.) Blender output plugin or at least a movtar enpacking program

.) mpeg2encode directly from movtar files
   (if this is reasonably easy)
  -> 22 kHz, 11kHz reading functions ... 
  -> multiplexing functions

.) "Normal" read/write support (position in the file, and then 
    start writing over there (needs a new internal writing position info))

.) Read/write support with a special feature: 
   If the new written frame is smaller than the old one, preserve the old 
   filestructure, and mark the rest of the unused old filespace as "junk", 
   which can be reused the next time -> allows a new kind of clipping
   in without having to render a new movie all the time .. 
   
   Long, in the far distant future:
   Program a Virtual File system with these features

mjpeg:

.) Real support for interlaced playback

.) Hardware YUV-RGB-conversion ? 

.) jpeg compression
