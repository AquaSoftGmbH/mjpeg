These are some of my new ideas, I don't know if I am going to realize them - ever:

.) movtar_avi, movtar_index, movtar_enpack

.) Plugins for GIMP

.) Blender output plugin or at least a movtar enpacking program

.) mpeg2encode directly from movtar files
   (if this is reasonably easy)
  -> 22 kHz, 11kHz reading functions ... 
  -> multiplexing functions
  -> JPEG reading acceleration with MMX
  -> integrate all other external patches for mpeg2encode

.)
