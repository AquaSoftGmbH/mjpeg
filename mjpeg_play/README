lavtools: Linux Audio and Video TOOLS

Programs for recording and playback of audio and video under Linux.
Currently only the Iomega Buz is supported - more hardware can follow
if somebody wants that.


- "lavrec" is a program to record AVI and Quicktime files with
   the Iomega BUZ including sound recording from the soundcard.

- "lavplay" plays back AVI and Quicktime files with the Iomega BUZ
  (including sound).

- "xlav" in the directory xlav is a GUI for lavplay which permits
  fast forward/reverse, single frame stepping and simple editing

- "lavtrans" (in directory utils) converts a mixture of AVI files,
  Quicktime files  or Edit Lists into a single AVI or Quicktime file
  into single images or into WAV files.

- "lavaddwav" (in directory utils) lets you add another soundtrack
  (a WAV file) to an AVI/Quicktime file

- "mpeg2enc" for encoding AVI/Quicktime files and Edit Lists
  to MPEG-1/2 video streams

- "aenc" for encoding AVI/Quicktime files and Edit Lists
  to MPEG-1/2 audio streams


Attention: lavplay is mainly intended to play back files created by lavrec and
should also be able to play back AVI files created from the Iomega BUZ
under Win98.
The vast majority of AVI/Quicktime files will not be played by lavplay!!!
The reason is that lavplay needs specialy coded AVI files (MJPG codec),
all other files don't have that codec and can not be used by the BUZ.



Compile:

I know its complicated, but follow exactly the steps below!

Quicktime4linux needs jpeg-6b, since my system (SuSE 6.3) still provides
jpeg-6a, I have included jpeg-6b here.
If jpeg-6b is allready installed on your system, you may want to remove
that directory and change the Makefiles accordingly.

- go into directory jpeg-6b, do

  ./configure
  make libjpeg.a

- go into directory quicktime, type make

- type make in the main directory

- go into directory xlav, type make
  xlav needs the xforms toolkit, you may have to get it from the net
  and you may have to change the Makefile

- go into directory utils, type make

- go into directory mpeg2enc, type make

- go into directory mpeg2audio, type make



Run:


Look at the headers of lavrec.c and lavplay.c for the available options.

lavtrans.c and lavaddwav.c also have short description of usage.
(See below!)

xlav is started using the same params as lavplay, lavplay is internally called
by xlav and therefore has to be in the search path. Make sure the proper
version of lavplay is found!

Read the 'README' in mpeg2eng!

Read the 'README' in mpegaudio!

UTILS:

lavtrans -o <outputfile> -f [aqiw] filenames
          -f a    output AVI file
          -f q    output Quicktime file
          -f i    output single JPEG images, -o option mut be a valid format string
          -f w    output WAV file (sound only!)

lavaddwav AVI_or_QT_file WAV_file Output_file
