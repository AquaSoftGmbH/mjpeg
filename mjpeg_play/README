lavtools: Linux Motion JPEG and MPEG Audio and Video TOOLS
==========================================================

Programs for MJPEG recording and playback and simple cut-and-paste
editting and MPEG compression of audio and video under Linux.

N.b. Only the "lav" programs have been written from scratch.  The
rest are from diverse open source sources, modified slightly to work
with the lav tools edit lists and AVI and quicktime files.  Some
(especially the MPEG tools) have had also more major perfomance 
and functionality enhancements.   They're all bundled together here to
save you the tedious hunting around we have to go through ;-)


* The lavtools, xlav and utils directories

The latest and greatest versions of Rainer Johanni's original
lavtools.  Plus some extra goodies to link them to the MPEG
compression tools.

- "lavrec" is a program to record AVI and Quicktime MJPEG files with
   the Iomega BUZ etc including sound recording from the soundcard.

- "lavplay" plays back AVI and Quicktime MJPEG files or "xlav" produced
  edit files with the Iomega BUZ etc  (including sound).

- "xlav" in the directory xlav is a GUI for lavplay which permits
  fast forward/reverse, single frame stepping and simple non-destructive 
  editing.  Instead of writing new AVI or Quicktime files xlav creates an
  "edit list" file with pointers to the relevant bits of the original files.
  The lav tools and MPEG encoding tools can all work directly with these files
  as well as Quicktime and AVI files.  Since these files have simple plain-text
  format they can easily be manually editted or use for other tools.
	
- "lavtrans" (in directory utils) converts a mixture of AVI files,
  Quicktime files  or Edit Lists into a single AVI or Quicktime file
  into single images or into WAV files.

- "lavaddwav" (in directory utils) lets you add another soundtrack
  (a WAV file) to an AVI/Quicktime file

- "lavvideo" is a small test application for the video overlay
   capabilities of your V4L hardware device.

- "lav2yuv" decodes AVI and Quicktime MJPEG and edit lists video and
outputs it to standard out the simple raw YUV video format expected by
the MPEG compressor "mpeg2enc" (see below).

- "lav2wav" decodes AVI and Quicktime MJPEG and edit lists video and
outputs it to standard out the WAV format expected by the MPEG layer 2
audio compressor "mp2enc" (see below.  If you output to a pipe it
simply sticks a maxium length in the header.  Most programs processing
streams will  work fine with this, ending cleanly when they reach the actual end.

- "lavtrans" Takes a list of edit lists and/or files and produces the
corresponding singleAVI or Quicktime file.

- "lavaddwav" Adds an audio stream to a Quicktime or AVI without one.

- "v4l-conf" is used in X to set up your video framebuffer address

* The scripts directory

	Turning a video stream captured as MJPEG AVI's or Quicktime files
	using a capture card into MPEG or transcoding a MPEG-2 file
	involves several steps and multiple programs. This directory
	contains several useful shell scripts that automagically
	do the right thing for common encoding tasks. They're also
	intended as	examples of typical uses.


* The mpeg2enc directory

- "mpeg2enc" for encoding AVI/Quicktime files and Edit Lists
  to MPEG-1/2 video streams.   It creates two programs.
  mpeg2enc (the encoder proper) and "lav2yuv".  mpeg2enc expects
  a simple "raw" YUV video format on its standard input (see README in
  the directory for details of the format).  Typically you'd therefore
  pipe the output of lav2yuv into mpeg2enc.  This two-program approach
  is chosen for primarily for flexibility.  Using appropriate filter
  programs other than lav2yuv it is easy to use mpeg2enc to compress
  other types of video stream.  For example, the "livid" MPEG-2
  decoder/DVD player can produce the output expected by "mpeg2enc" so
  that in combination they can be used to reduce high bit-rate
  MPEG-2 formats to smaller MPEG-2 or MPEG-1 formats.

* The aenc directory - 

	Ccontains the source files for "mp2enc" the MPEG-1 layer 2 audio
	compressor. It is not particularly good as encoders go, but is
	included for simplicity and completeness.  It also has the virtue
	that for transcoding applications (e.g. AC3 to mp2) it can do
	sampling rate conversions.  You need this to compress audio.

	In general, however, you'd be better off with the faster and more
	capable "toolame" encoder.  For transcoding applications the good old
	stand-by "sox" will convert sampling rates very nicely (albeit it'll 
	moan a bit about incorrect headers if you use it in a pipeline).

	You may wish to try  using your favourite MPEG 1 layer 3 "MP3" 
	encoder for better quality results.  However, make sure you 
	use constant bit-rate  and turn of any extensions to the format.  
	I have no idea how many players actually cope with layer 3.  Drop
	as@comlab.ox.ac.uk an email if you get it to work!

* The mplex directory

	Contains for the source files the "mplex" multiplexer.
	This multiplexes (interleaves) MPEG-1/2 video and audio streams
  into a combined "system stream" that can be played back smoothly.
  This is *not* as trivial a task as it might seem (see the original
  authors paper on the subject - copy is in the documentation). Note that
  the program has been fairly heavily modified since then.
  MPEG-2 multiplexing is implemented but is currently untested.



* The mjpeg directory

Contains libraries to handle the new MJPEG movtar video format and a
library to simplify MJPEG software and hardware playback,
respectively.  Please read the accompanying README files in these
directories for more information.

See the README's of the various programs for further details
of authorship, usage, and implementation/compilation details.


Attention: lavplay is mainly intended to play back files created by
lavrec and should also be able to play back AVI files created from the
Iomega BUZ under Win98.  The vast majority of AVI/Quicktime files will
not be played by lavplay!!!  (see http://dix.euro.ru for such codecs)
The reason is that lavplay needs specially coded AVI files (stored
with an MJPG codec), all other files don't use that codec and can
therefore not be played back by the BUZ.
