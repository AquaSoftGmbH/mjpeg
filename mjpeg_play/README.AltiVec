Platform specific comments:

    Linux:
    
	AltiVec enabled compilers are not yet widely distributed.  This
	should change now that GCC 3.1 has been released.  However, GCC
	3.1 has issues compiling certain parts of this AltiVec library.
	When GCC's AltiVec support matures, it should be able to compile
	the code (with minor changes).  Until then, gcc 2.96.4 with the
	Motorola AltiVec patches works just fine. There are AltiVec enabled
	GCC compilers maintained by Kaoru Fukui at
	ftp://ppc.linux.or.jp/pub/users/fukui/.

        You will also need a recent binutils package. I've verified that
        binutils-2.12.90.0.7 works. It is also the recommended version
        for GCC 3.1. There may also be suitable binutils packages at
        Kaoru's FTP site.
    
    Mac OS X:
    
        If you have the developer tools, you're all set.


General comments:

    Additional performance can be gained by setting the -mcpu option. For
    GCC 2.95.* use -mcpu=750, for GCC 3.1 and higher try -mcpu=7400 or
    -mcpu=7450.

    This option can be added during configuration by setting the CFLAGS
    environment variable. For example:

    env CFLAGS="-O2 -mcpu=750" ./configure
