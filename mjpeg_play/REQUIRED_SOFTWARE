This is the required software for compiling the tools here:

.) A 2.2.x kernel (the driver needs it). 

.) libjpeg6 (preferrably libjpeg6b)
(libjpeg .... is included in the standard distributions)

.) The GLib library - http://www.gtk.org
(libglib .... is included in the standard distributions)

And for people who want to use ALSA support (currently non-working):
.) ALSA driver/lib (http://alsa.jcu.cz)
