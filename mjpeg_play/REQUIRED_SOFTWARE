This is the required software for compiling the tools here:

.) Quicktime4Linux 1.2.0 - http://heroine.linuxave.net/quicktime.html

The configure scripts look for this in /usr/local/src/quicktime by default.
You can specify another directory using the --with-quicktime flag to
the ./configure script.

N.b. it would seem that quicktime-1.2 is a little picky about the compilers
it is built under.  You may get complaints about missing functions.
If so you need to try a more up-to-date gcc or egcs or an older quicktime
library that doesn't include the offending code (support for digital
video that makes heavy use of inline's). 

.) libjpeg6 (preferrably libjpeg6b, an alpha, MMX patched version is included )
(libjpeg6a or 6b is included in the standard distributions)

.) The GLib library - http://www.gtk.org
(libglib .... is included in the standard distributions)

.) The SDL library -  http://www.libsdl.org/
   I used SDL 1.1.3 for development, please tell me if the 
   new SDL versions won't compile with this software ! 

A remark regarding RPM packages:
If you want to install RPM packages instead, always keep in mind that 
you need to install the developing 
---
.) libmovtar (movtar video format library)
   and
   libmjpeg (MJPEG hardware/software playback) 
   are currently included, but being prepared to become separate packages.

And for people who want to use ALSA support (currently not useful, since it only uses emulation):
.) ALSA driver/lib (http://alsa.jcu.cz)

(www.freshmeat.net is also a good source for all kind of Linux soft !)
