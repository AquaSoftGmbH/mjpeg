This is the required software for compiling the tools here:

.) Quicktime4Linux 1.2.0 - http://heroine.linuxave.net/quicktime.html

.) libjpeg6 (preferrably libjpeg6b, an alpha, MMX patched version is included )
(libjpeg6a or 6b is included in the standard distributions)

.) The GLib library - http://www.gtk.org
(libglib .... is included in the standard distributions)

.) The SDL library -  http://www.libsdl.org/
   I used SDL 1.1.3 for development, please tell me if the 
   new SDL versions won't compile with this software ! 

A remark regarding RPM packages:
If you want to install RPM packages instead, always keep in mind that 
you need to install the developing 
---
.) libmovtar (movtar video format library)
   and
   libmjpeg (MJPEG hardware/software playback) 
   are currently included, but being prepared to become separate packages.

And for people who want to use ALSA support (currently not useful, since it only uses emulation):
.) ALSA driver/lib (http://alsa.jcu.cz)

(www.freshmeat.net is also a good source for all kind of Linux soft !)
