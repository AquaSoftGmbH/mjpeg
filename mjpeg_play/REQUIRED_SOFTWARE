Software you *must* have installed

1) Quicktime4Linux 1.2.0 - http://heroine.linuxave.net/quicktime.html

The configure scripts look for this in /usr/local/src/quicktime by default.
You can specify another directory using the --with-quicktime flag to
the ./configure script.

N.b. it would seem that quicktime-1.2 is a little picky about the compilers
it is built under.  You may get complaints about missing functions.
If so you need to try a more up-to-date gcc or egcs or an older quicktime
library that doesn't include the offending code (support for digital
video that makes heavy use of inline's). If this is the case a hacked version
of Q4L can be found where you found this.

2) libjpeg6 (libjpeg6a or 6b is included in the standard
distributions) 

A faster MMX patched version can be found with where you obtained this
software.  A ./configure script option allows this to be installed in
addition to the standard libjpeg6 to avoid the risk of breaking
existing software.


3) The GLib library - http://www.gtk.org
(libglib .... is included in the standard distributions)

4) The SDL library -  http://www.libsdl.org/
   I used SDL 1.1.3 for development, please tell me if the 
   new SDL versions won't compile with this software ! 

Software you'll find useful

1) The "toolame" MP2 encoder and the "sox" audio processing tool.

A remark regarding RPM packages: If you want to install RPM packages
instead, always keep in mind that you need to install the developer
versions.

(www.freshmeat.net is also a good source for all kind of Linux soft !)
