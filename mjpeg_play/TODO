Fix all the BUGS (see BUGS) of course!

IMMEDIATE

Finish tidying up mplex so it meshes correctly with the sequence splitting
support in mpeg2enc.

TASKS OUTSTANDING

Minor

- Go through MJPEG lib and add proper error returns.  Go through lavplay
	and lavrec and add proper error handling and break up those oversize
	functions.

- The filtering / decimation code in the lav* utilities should be seperated 
	from the stream extraction.  An extractor is needed for the favoured
	format of the mpeg2dec developer.

- Mention transcoding in the Documentation.  Mention the stuff relating to
  seq headers and similar VCD tricker too...

- Change the build structure to seperate the MPEG from the lav tools.

- Fix the overly pessimistic data-rate estimation in mplex.

- Turn the crappy "HINTS" file into nice introductory documentation on
  working with these programs to achieve the best results in typical
  scenarios.

Medium

- Chrominance is only taken into account for motion compensation in P-frame's
	for progressive sequences.  Curiously, experimentation showed that
	extension to B-frames was counter-productive. So it is *deliberately*
	not done for them. The necessary code is all written and tested.
	We need to properly resolve this question and extend chrominanc checking
	to P frames in field pictures.
	Also, inclusion of chrominance wieghting should probably be used
	at least from the 22 sub-sampled search level onwards.  Not just as
	a "bail out to Intra coding as present".  Again the issue isn't clear
	as the main need for chrominance checking is when scene changes mean
	MC is nonsense.
	Once we add	scene-change detection it probably won't really matter.

- Get lavtools to use the new up-to-date headers from the drivers...

- Add support for encoding raw (YUV and RGB) AVI files.  	

- Modify mplex to a decent job at mpeg stream splitting.  The solution
	would be to get mpeg2enc to insert regular sequence headers at the
	start of GOP's.  mplex could then simply split at these points.

- Beef up xlav to make splitting an editted stream set into multiple
  edit lists for parallel compression less tedious.

- Add the code to do DVD multiplexing into mplex.  This is
mainly the addition of facilities to mux in AC-3 as stream PRIVATE1.
As ever Brent Byeler's "bbmpeg" is a good source here.

- Get rid of the silly compulsorary two-pass thing in mplex, replace with a
look-ahead reader instead.

Major

- Improve quality of mpeg2enc's output to the level of the best
commercial encoders.  I.e. add scene change detection and dynamic GOP
sizing plus some "intelligent" pre-filtering options to blur
mosaics. Make it go *still faster* ;-)

- <Gernot's wish-list for the lavtools here...>
