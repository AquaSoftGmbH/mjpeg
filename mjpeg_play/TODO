Fix all the BUGS (see BUGS) of course!


TASKS OUTSTANDING

- yuvdenoiser needs to be tidied up with redundant scaffolding code
removed once we're sure everything is working correctly.
	
- Modify yuvscaler to generate MPEG aspect ratio codes if desired?

Code hygiene  basically: GNU guidelines!
Basically if you want a nice example of how it should be done take
a look at the source code for vcdimager!


- A lot of the code is in fairly poor shape layout and stylistically.
	Minimally, some needs running through a C prettifier and having
	stuff like "unsigned char" replaced with appropriate types from
	stdint.h via utils/mjpeg_types.h.

- Need to test and build scripts for in-line multiplexing.

- The filtering / decimation code in the lav* utilities is now redundant
  with yuvscale in place... it should be removed once we're happy with
  yuvscale.


Medium

- Find a proper SSE DCT and iDCT.

- Test support for field pictures to mplex. Not urgent since for most
  sources frame pictures with field DCT/motion compensation seems to
  give better results.

- Add the code to do DVD multiplexing into mplex.  This is
mainly the addition of facilities to mux in AC-3 as stream PRIVATE1.
As ever Brent Byeler's "bbmpeg" is a good source here.


Major

-	Continuation of frozen encoding sessions.
