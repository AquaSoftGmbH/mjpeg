TASKS OUTSTANDING

Minor

- Tidy up linkage to quicktime, sort out whether lavtools and the
  MPEG stuff is going to be embedded or not... 

- A proper co-ordinate autoconf/automake environment for the whole shebang!

Medium

- Modify mplex to improve speed and remove the need for mpegjoin

- Beef up xlav to make splitting an editted stream set into multiple
  edit lists for parallel compression less tedious.

- Turn the crappy "HINTS" file into nice introductory documentation on
  working with these programs to achieve the best results in typical
  scenarios.

Major

- Improve quality of mpeg2enc's output to the level of the best commercial
  encoders.  Make it go *still faster*  ;-)
