Fix all the BUGS (see BUGS) of course!

TASKS OUTSTANDING

Minor

- Diff the plug-in's with the livid source-base and send it to the developers.

- Change the build structure to seperate the MPEG from the lav tools.

- Turn the crappy "HINTS" file into nice introductory documentation on
  working with these programs to achieve the best results in typical
  scenarios.

Medium

- Modify mplex to a decent job at mpeg stream splitting.  Its *almost* there, just needs
  to be able to regenerate headers...

- Beef up xlav to make splitting an editted stream set into multiple
  edit lists for parallel compression less tedious.

- The new quantizer is only used on the most crucial (non-intra frame)
routine. A fast intra quantizer would be nice too.

- Add the code to do DVD and SVCD multiplexing into mplex.  This is
mainly the addition of facilities to mux in AC-3 as stream PRIVATE1.
As ever Brent Byeler's "bbmpeg" is a good source here.

- Get rid of the silly compulsorary two-pass thing in mplex, replace with a
look-ahead reader instead?

Major

- Improve quality of mpeg2enc's output to the level of the best
commercial encoders.  I.e. add scene change detection and dynamic GOP
sizing plus some "intelligent" pre-filtering options to blur
mosaics. Make it go *still faster* ;-)

- <Gernot's wish-list for the lavtools here...>
