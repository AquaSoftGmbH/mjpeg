TASKS OUTSTANDING

Minor

- Update the included scripts to reflect the new seperate input filter
architecture for the  mpeg decoder.

- Diff the plug-in's with the livid source-base and send it to the developers.

- Change the build structure to seperate the MPEG from the lav tools.

- Turn the crappy "HINTS" file into nice introductory documentation on
  working with these programs to achieve the best results in typical
  scenarios.

Medium

- Build some tidied up mpeg tools (e.g. a version of mpegjoin that works cleanly).

- Beef up xlav to make splitting an editted stream set into multiple
  edit lists for parallel compression less tedious.

- The new quantizer is only used on the most crucial (non-intra frame)
routine. It needs to be converted into a more efficient fully
table-driven form and adapted for intra frames too.

- Test to make sure no bugs crept in mpeg-2 encoding with the new
motion compensation code.

- Add the code to do DVD and SVCD multiplexing into mplex.  This is
mainly the addition of facilities to mux in AC-3 as stream PRIVATE1.
As ever Brent Byeler's "bbmpeg" is a good source here.

- Merge support for streamed wav's into aenc.  Perhaps replace it with
the superior "toolame" code base? 

- The mpeg2enc code still has a lot of "scaffolding" to support the
forthcoming	addition of gradient-descent based motion compensation.
Lots of "Code hygiene" improvements to be undertaken to modernise the code
base and allow better compiler checking...

- Get rid of the silly compulsorary two-pass thing in mplex, replace with a
look-ahead reader instead?

Major

- Improve quality of mpeg2enc's output to the level of the best
commercial encoders.  I.e. add look-ahead bit-allocation and maybe
some "intelligent" pre-filtering options to blur mosaics. Make it go
*still faster* ;-)
