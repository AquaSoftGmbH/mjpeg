Fix all the BUGS (see BUGS) of course!

IMMEDIATE

Add support for field pictures to mplex.

TASKS OUTSTANDING

Minor

- Go through MJPEG lib and add proper error returns.  Go through lavplay
	and lavrec and add proper error handling and break up those oversize
	functions.

- The filtering / decimation code in the lav* utilities is now redundant
	with lavscale in place...


Medium

- Chrominance is only taken into account for motion compensation in P-frame's
	for progressive sequences.  Curiously, experimentation showed that
	extension to B-frames was counter-productive. So it is *deliberately*
	not done for them. The necessary code is all written and tested.
	We need to properly resolve this question and extend chrominanc checking
	to P frames in field pictures.
	Also, inclusion of chrominance wieghting should probably be used
	at least from the 22 sub-sampled search level onwards.  Not just as
	a "bail out to Intra coding as present".  Again the issue isn't clear
	as the main need for chrominance checking is when scene changes mean
	MC is nonsense.
	Once we add	scene-change detection it probably won't really matter.

- Get lavtools to use the new up-to-date headers from the drivers...

- Add support for encoding raw (YUV and RGB) AVI files.  	

- Add the code to do DVD multiplexing into mplex.  This is
mainly the addition of facilities to mux in AC-3 as stream PRIVATE1.
As ever Brent Byeler's "bbmpeg" is a good source here.

- Get rid of the silly compulsorary two-pass thing in mplex, replace with a
look-ahead reader instead.

Major

-  I.e. add a dynamic noise reduction filter and an "intelligent" 
   blurring to suppress mosaics. Make it go *still faster* ;-)
