TASKS OUTSTANDING

Minor

- Tidy up linkage to quicktime, sort out whether lavtools and the
  MPEG stuff is going to be embedded or not... 

Medium

- Modify mplex to improve speed and remove the need for mpegjoin

- Beef up xlav to make splitting an editted stream set into multiple
  edit lists for parallel compression less tedious.

- Turn the crappy "HINTS" file into nice introductory documentation on
  working with these programs to achieve the best results in typical
  scenarios.


-	The new quantizer is only used on the most crucial (non-intra frame) routine.
	It needs to be converted into a more efficient fully table-driven
	form and adapted for intra frames too.

-	The code is still full of a "scaffolding" to support the forthcoming
	addition of gradient-descent based motion compensation.
	Lots of "Code hygiene" improvements to be undertaken to modernise the code
	base and allow better compiler checking...

Major

- Improve quality of mpeg2enc's output to the level of the best commercial
  encoders.  Make it go *still faster*  ;-)


- 	THE BIGGY: Brent Byeler's hard work to support variable bit-rate SVCD
	and DVD properly in the mpeg2enc / aenc / mplex derived "bbmpeg"
	for windows should be merged in.  It's next on my list.
