IMMEDIATE


Fix all the BUGS (see BUGS) of course!


TASKS OUTSTANDING

Add support for large files.

Code hygiene  basically: GNU guidelines!
Basically if you want a nice example of how it should be done take
a look at the source code for vcdimager!

- A lot of the code is in fairly poor shape layout and stylistically.
	Minimally, some needs running through a C prettifier and having
	stuff like "unsigned char" replaced with appropriate types from
	stdint.h via utils/mjpeg_types.h.

- The filtering / decimation code in the lav* utilities is now redundant
	with yuvscale in place... it should be removed once we're happy with
	yuvscale.


- Go through MJPEG lib and add proper error returns.  Go through lavplay
	and lavrec and add proper error handling and break up those oversize
	functions.

- The single-letter soup of the various getopts needs to be replaced
	with getopts_long style command lines.


Medium

- Move the CPU detection code into utils and use the same throughout.

- Find a proper SSE DCT and iDCT.

- Add support for field pictures to mplex. Not urgent since for most
  sources frame pictures with field DCT/motion compensation seems to
  give better results.

- Get lavtools to use the new up-to-date headers from the drivers...

- Add support for encoding raw (YUV and RGB) AVI files.  	

- Add the code to do DVD multiplexing into mplex.  This is
mainly the addition of facilities to mux in AC-3 as stream PRIVATE1.
As ever Brent Byeler's "bbmpeg" is a good source here.

- Get rid of the silly compulsorary two-pass thing in mplex, replace with a
look-ahead reader instead.

Major

-  I.e. add a dynamic noise reduction filter and an "intelligent" 
   blurring to suppress mosaics. Make it go *still faster* ;-)

-	Continuation of frozen encoding sessions.
