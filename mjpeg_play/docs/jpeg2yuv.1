.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBjpeg2yuv\fP decompresses a sequence of JPEG files
and pipes the image data to stdout as a YUV4MPEG2 stream.
Any JPEG format supported by libjpeg can be read.
stdout will be filled with the YUV4MPEG2 movie data stream,
so be prepared to pipe it on to mpeg2enc or to write it into a file.

\fBThis is not the utility you are looking for.\fP  This program is
primarily a diagnostic utility for debugging MJPEG recordings, not for
making movies from standard graphics JPEG images.  It does
not make any attempt to convert the full-range pixel data from standard
JPEG's into the padded-range pixel data used in digital video.
The utility you are probably looking for is \fBppmtoy4m\fP(1), which
is also included in MJPEGtools.

.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBjpeg2yuv\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 5
.BI \-b " num" 
Frame offset:  skip output of the first 'num' frames.  (default: 0)
.TP 5
.BI \-f " num"
Set the frame rate of stream accepts the same numbers. Not default, this option has to be specified.
.TP 5
.BI \-I " num"
interlacing mode:
p = none / progressive
.br
t = top field first
.br
b = bottom field first
.br
No default, this option has to be specified.
.TP 5
.BI \-L " num"
0 = non-interleaved (two successive fields per JPEG file)
.br
1 = interleaved fields
.TP 5
.BI \-l " num"
Specifies the nummber of loops (default: 0 loops )
.br
When this option is not used the given range of images is only processed once. If you use this option and as num -1, jpeg2yv will loop forever writing the image to stdout. When you use n > 0 it will loop. n-time till it finishes.
.TP 5
.BI \-n " num"
Specifies the nummber of frames to process. (default: all = -1)
.TP 5 
.BI \-j " {1}%{2}d{3}"
Read JPEG frames with the name components as follows:
 {1} JPEG filename prefix (e g: picture_ )
 {2} Counting placeholder (like in C, printf, eg 06 ))
 {3} File extension. Something like this: .jpg
A correct description of the files could look like this: picture_%06d.jpg
.TP 5
.BI \-v " num"
Verbosity level (0, 1 or 2)

.SH BUGS
The frame rate desciption seems not to be up to date. The NTSC integer ratios seems not to be suportet well. As workaround specify a PAL (25) or nativ FILM (24) and set the right frame rate in mpeg2enc with the -F option.
