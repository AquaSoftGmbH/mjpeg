.SH "NAME"
lav2wav \- Extract the audio out of MJPEG container files to stdout
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
lav2wav [params] [filename(s)]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlav2wav\fP can be used to extract the audio to stdout.
This output goes to stdout and can be saved as a wav file, or piped to an 
other sound processing tool, that is able to handle wave. 
This can be mp2enc and toolame for mpeg layer 2 audio, 
or for example lame for mpeg layer 3 audio. 

As input sources you can use serveral files, mixing up with editlistfiles. 

.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBlav2wav\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 5
.B \-s num
Start extracting at video frame (num)
.TP 5
.B \-c num
Extract (num) frames of audio
.TP 5
.B \-v num
Verbosity level (0, 1 or 2)

.SH BUGS

The "WAV" file format (technically: RIFF) is really very much less
than ideal for a tool intended to be used in pipelines as lav2wav is.
The Problem is that the header includes a field specifying the length
of the file.  This can't be filled in except by seeking back to the
begining and over-writing.  If the output is unseek-able (e.g. pipe
lav2wav simply writes a large length into the header and leaves it at
that).  Most tools like sox(1) or mp2enc(1) either ignore the length
field anyway or only give a warning.
