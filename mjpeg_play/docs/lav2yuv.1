.SH "NAME"
lav2yuv \- Convert a MJPEG file to raw yuv
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
lav2uv [params] [filename(s)]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlav2yuv\fP converts an MJPEG video sequence described by a sequence
of MJPEG video files and/or edit lists pointing to such files into the
simple uncompressed planar YUV format expected by the used by the
\fBmpeg2enc\fP(1) MPEG encoder and image processing filters like
\fByuvscaler\f(1) or \fByuv2dfilter\fP(1).

Output is to stdout so that by piping the output of lav2yuv into a
suitable pipeline it is possible to process and then encode or play
back video recorded in any of the mjpegtools MJPEG container formats:
AVI, quicktime or movtar or edit lists describing editted versions of
videon held in such files.

For historical reasons lav2yuv has simple scaling and cropping facilities
built-in although superior facilities are also available through the
\fByuvscaler\fP(1) filter.

Mixing differnt files with different video formats is currently not possible.

The \-S \-T \-D options are used for scene detection, which is used by linuxvideosstudio.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBlav2yuv\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 5
.B \-a widthxhight+x+y
Sets everything that is not in the described area to black
.TP 4
.B \-s num   
Special output format option:
 0 output like input, nothing special
 1 create half height/width output from input
 2 create 480 wide output from 720 wide input (SVCD)
 3 create 352 wide output from 720 wide input (VCD)
 4 create 480 x 480 output from 720 x 240 input (SVCD)
.TP 5
.B \-d [0..3]
Drop lsbs of samples (default: 0) Improves the quality a bit, because the less sigificant bits of every sample aere dropped. Reduces the number of different colors. 
.TP 5
.B \-n [0..2]
Noise filter (low\-pass) (default: 0) This removes low fequency noise in the picture. 
.TP 5
.B \-m 
Force mono\-chrome
.TP 5
.B \-S list.el
Output a scene list with scene detection
.TP 5
.B \-T num
Set scene detection threshold to num (default: 4)
.TP 5
.B \-D num
Width decimation to use for scene detection (default: 2)
.TP 5
.B \-o num
Frame offset skip num frames in the beginning if num is negative, 
all but the last num frames are skipped
.TP 5
.B \-f num
Only num frames are written to stdout. 0 means that all frames aure procced.
