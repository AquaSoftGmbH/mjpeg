.SH "NAME"
lav2yuv \- Convert a MJPEG file to raw yuv

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B lav2yuv
.RI [ options ]
.I filename " ..."

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlav2yuv\fP converts an MJPEG video sequence described by a sequence
of MJPEG video files and/or edit lists pointing to such files into the
simple uncompressed planar YUV format. Used by \fBmpeg2enc\fP(1) 
MPEG encoder and image processing filters like
\fByuvscaler\fP(1) or \fByuv2dfilter\fP(1) or \fByuvdenoise\fP(1).

Output is to stdout so that by piping the output of lav2yuv into a
suitable pipeline it is possible to process and then encode or play
back video recorded in any of the mjpegtools MJPEG container formats:
AVI, quicktime or movtar or edit lists describing editted versions of
video held in such files.

For historical reasons lav2yuv has simple scaling and cropping facilities
built\-in although superior facilities are also available through the
\fByuvscaler\fP(1) filter.

Mixing differnt files with different video formats is currently not possible.

The \fB\-S \-T \-D\fP options are used for scene detection,
which is used by linux video studio.

.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBlav2yuv\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 5
.BI \-a " widthxhight+x+y"
Sets everything that is not in the described area to black
.TP 5
.BI \-n \ [0..2]
Noise filter (low\-pass) (default: 0) This removes reduce
high-frequency components in the picture.  1 is mild.  2 is quite
strong.

.TP 5
.BI \-m 
Force mono\-chrome
.TP 5
.BI \-x 
Exchange fields for interlaced frames
.TP 5
.BI \-F 
Shift fields (corrects capturing frames wrong field first)
.TP 5
.BI \-S " list.el"
Output a scene list with scene detection
.TP 5
.BI \-T " num"
Set scene detection threshold to num (default: 4)
.TP 5
.BI \-D " num"
Width decimation to use for scene detection (default: 2)
.TP 5
.BI \-o " num"
Frame offset skip num frames in the beginning if num is negative, 
all but the last num frames are skipped
.TP 5
.BI \-f " num"
Only num frames are written to stdout. 0 means that all frames are processed. 
.TP 5
.BI \-I \ [0..3]
De-Interlacing mode for DV input 
.TP 5
.BI \-i \ [0..65025]
De-Interlacing spatial threshold (default: 440) for DV
.TP 5
.BI \-j \ [0..65025]
De-Interlacing temporal threshold (default: 220) for DV
.TP 5
.BI \-Y
switch field order in DV input
.TP 5
.BI \-A \ width:height
Set/override the sample aspect ratio (SAR) emitted in the output stream
header.  (Currently, the SAR is only auto-detected for DV files.)
.TP 5
.BI \-P \ code
Label the output stream with an intended display aspect ratio - that
is a code identifying aspect ratio of the hwole the picture when it is
displayed.  This is primarily intended for MPEG encoders.
.IP
1 indicates
square pixels (the aspect ratio is given by the dimensions of the
sampling grid).
.IP
2 indicates a 4:3 aspect ratio.
.IP
3 indicates a 16:9 aspect ratio.
.IP
4 indicates a 2.21:1 aspect ratio.
