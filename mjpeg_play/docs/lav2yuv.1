.SH "NAME"
lav2yuv \- Convert a MJPEG file to raw yuv
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
lav2uv [params] [filename(s)]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlav2yuv\fP can be used to create a YUV stream of the recorded video. 
This output goes to stdout and can be feed (piped) into yuvscaler, mpeg2enc, 
yuv2lav, yuvplay and yuvmedianfilter for example. 

It is used to create from the recorded MJPEG streams in AVI, quicktime or 
movtar the YUV data that is needed for encoding with mpeg2enc. 

It can do scaling but for this you can also use yuvscaler. 

As input sources you can use serveral files, mixing up with editlistfiles. 
Mixing differnt sizes of videos is not allowed. 

The \-S \-T \-D options are used for scene detection, which is used by linuxvideosstudio.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBlav2yuv\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 5
.B \-a widthxhight+x+y
Sets everything that is not in the described area to black
.TP 4
.B \-s num   
Special output format option:
 0 output like input, nothing special
 1 create half height/width output from input
 2 create 480 wide output from 720 wide input (SVCD)
 3 create 352 wide output from 720 wide input (VCD)
 4 create 480 x 480 output from 720 x 240 input (SVCD)
.TP 5
.B \-d [0..3]
Drop lsbs of samples (default: 0) Improves the quality a bit, because the less sigificant bits of every sample aere dropped. Reduces the number of different colors. 
.TP 5
.B \-n [0..2]
Noise filter (low\-pass) (default: 0) This removes low fequency noise in the picture. 
.TP 5
.B \-m 
Force mono\-chrome
.TP 5
.B \-S list.el
Output a scene list with scene detection
.TP 5
.B \-T num
Set scene detection threshold to num (default: 4)
.TP 5
.B \-D num
Width decimation to use for scene detection (default: 2)
.TP 5
.B \-o num
Frame offset skip num frames in the beginning if num is negative, 
all but the last num frames are skipped
.TP 5
.B \-f num
Only num frames are written to stdout. 0 means that all frames aure procced.
