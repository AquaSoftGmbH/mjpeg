.SH NAME
lavplay \- Playback MJPEG video
.SH SYNOPSIS
lavplay [options] [filename(s)]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlavplay\fP can be used to playback video in MJPEG format (either
quicktime, movtar or AVI) on a zoran video-capture device, such as
the Miro/Pinnacle DC10(+), the Iomega Buz or Linux Media Labs' LML33,
or in software mode (using SDL).
.SH OPTIONS
\fBlavplay\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-S, -H or -C
The playback mode to be used. \-S means software\-playback using SDL.
\-H means hardware\-playback on the monitor (full\-screen). \-C means
hardware\-playback to the video-out of the zoran video-capture device.
Obviously, \-C and \-H only work on computers with zoran video\-capture
devices.
.TP 8
.B \-Z
Software full-screen playback. This only works if SDL-playback is chosen
(-S), and will playback the video full-screen instead of in a window.
.TP 8
.B \-a [01]
Enables (1) or disables (0) audio playback.
.TP 8
.B \-z
Zooms the video to fit the screen as good as possible.
.TP 8
.B \-x
Exchange fileds of an interlaced video. Try this if the video looks weird.
.TP 8
.B \-s num
Skip <num> seconds of video at the beginning.
.TP 8
.B \-o [np]
Forces the use of PAL (p) or NTSC (n). By default, the use of either PAL
or NTSC is guessed from the framerate of the first input video.
.TP 8
.B \-c [01]
Enables (1) or disables (0) the use of sync corrections.
.TP 8
.B \-X num, \-Y num
Horizontal (-X) and vertical (-Y) offset when using hardware-playback of
a video which does not cover the full video hardware-resolution.
.TP 8
.B \-q
Makes lavplay stay alive at the end of the video (lavplay won't quit).
Use 'q<enter>' on the command line to quit (see below, \fBSEARCHING
AND EDITING\fP).
.TP 8
.B \-g
Enables GUI-mode. This is used by xlav and Linux Video Studio. It will
output the current position in the video each frame, so that the xlav
or LVS can keep track of where we are in the video which is being played
back.
.TP 8
.B \-n num
Number of MJPEG-buffers. Default is 32. Try changing this number if you
have many lost frames.
.TP 8
.B \-v num
Verbosity level (0, 1 or 2)
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables can be recognized by lavrec:
.TP 8
.B LAV_VIDEO_DEV
The video device. Default is /dev/video
.TP 8
.B LAV_AUDIO_DEV
The audio device. Default is /dev/dsp
.SH SEARCHING AND EDITING
\fBlavplay\fP can do more than simple plain playback. On the command-
line, while playing back, one can type commands to search through the
video or perform simple editing (NLE) functions. The following commands
are recognized by lavplay:
.TP 8
.B +, \-
Goes to next/previous frame. Only makes sense when the video is paused.
.TP 8
.B pN
Sets playback speed to N (N=..., -1, 0, 1, ...)
.TP 8
.B a[01]
Enables/disables audio playback
.TP 8
.B sN
if N is a number, this means to go to frame N. if N is prefixed by a +
or -, this means to go N frames back- or forward.
.TP 8
.B om editlist [N1 N2 [N3 N4]]
Opens a movie or editlist. A second and third argument can specify to
only open a specific range of frames from this video (N1=-1 means whole
video). N3 and N4 can specify to show only a specific range of frames
from the frames which were just opened (useful for trimming).
.TP 8
.B w[as] file
Save the current editlist (a) or the current selection (s) to a file.
.TP 8
.B q
Quit lavplay.
.TP 8
.B e[ou] N1 N2
Cuts (u) or copies (o) frames N1-N2 from the current editlist into an
internal selection.
.TP 8
.B ep
Pastes the contents of the selection into the current position in the
editlist.
.TP 8
.B em N1 N2 N3
Moves frames N1-N2 to position N3 in the video.
.TP 8
.B ed N1 N2
Deletes frames N1-N2 from the editlist.
.TP 8
.B ea video N1 N2 N3
Adds frames N1-N2 of the video into position N3 within the editlist.
N1=-1 means to add the whole video.
.TP 8
.B es N1 N2
Sets the current viewable frames within the whole video to N1-N2. This
is useful for trimming.
