Trading Quality/Speed
*********************

   If absolute quality is your objective a modest improvement can be
achieved using the -4 and -2 flags.  These control how ruthlessly
mpeg2enc discards bad looking matches between sections of adjacent
frames during the early stages of the search when it is working with
4*4 and 2*2 clusters of pixels rather than individual pixels. Setting
-4 1 -2 1 maximizes quality. -4 4 -2 4 maximizes speed. Note that
because the statistical criteria mpeg2enc uses for discarding bad
looking matches are usually fairly reliable the increase/decrease in
quality is modest (but noticeable).

   Reducing the radius of the search for matching sections of images
also increases speed. However due to the way the search algorithm works
the search radius is in effect rounded to the nearest multiple of 8.
Furthermore, on modern CPU's the speed gained by reducing the radius
below 16 is not large enough to make the marked quality reduction
worthwhile for most applications.

Creating streams to be played from disk using Software players
==============================================================

   Usually MPEG player software is much more flexible than the hardware
built into DVD and VCD players. This flexibility allows for
significantly better compression to be achieved for the same quality.
The trick is to generate video streams that use big video buffers
(500KB or more) and variable bitrate encoding (the -f, -q flag to
mpeg2enc). Software players will often also correctly play back the
much more efficient MPEG layer 3 (yes, "MP3" audio format.  A good Mp3
encoder like lame will produce results comparable to layer 2 at 224Kbps
at 128Kbps or 160Kbps.

SMP and distributed Encoding
****************************

   The degree to which mpeg2enc tries to split work between concurrently
executing threads is controlled by the -M oder -multi-thread [0..32]
option. This optimizes mpeg2enc for the specified number of CPUs. By
default (-M 1), mpeg2enc runs with just a little multi-threading:
reading of frames happens concurrently with compression. This is done
to allow encoding pipelines that are split across several machines (see
below) to work efficiently without the need for special buffering
programs.  If you are encoding on a single-CPU machine where RAM is
tight you may find turning off multithreading altogether by setting -M
0 works slightly more efficiently.

   For SMP machines with two ore more processors you can speed up
mpeg2enc by setting the number of concurrently executing encoding
threads's you wish to utilize (e.g. -M 2). Setting -M 2 or -M 3 on a
2-way machine should allow you to speed up encoding by around 80%.

   Obviously, if your encoding pipeline contains several filtering
stages it is likely that you can keep two or more CPU's busy
simultaneously even without using -M. Denoising using yuvdenoise or
yuvmedianfilter is particular demanding and uses almost as much
processing power as MPEG encoding.

   It you more than one computer you can also split the encoding
pipeline between computers using the standard 'rsh' or 'rcmd' remote
shell execution commands. For example, if you have two computers:

   `> rsh machine1 lav2yuv "mycapture.eli | yuvscaler -O SVCD |
yuvdenoise" | mpeg2enc -f 4 -o mycapture.m2vi'

   Here the computer where you execute the command is doing the MPEG
encoding whilst "machine1" is the machine that is decoding scaling and
denoising the captured video.

   Obviously, for this to work "machine1" has to be able to access the
video and the computer where the command is executed has to have space
for the encoded video. In practice, it is usually well worth setting up
network file-storage using "NFS" or other packages if you are going to
do stuff like this.  If you have three computers you can take this a
stage further, one computer could do the decoding and scaling, the next
could do denoising and the third could do MPEG encoding:

   `> rsh machine1 "lav2yuv mycapture.eli | yuvscaler -O SVCD" |
yuvdenoise | rsh machine3 mpeg2enc -f 4 -o mycapture.m2v'

   `NOTE:'How the remote command executions are set up so that the data
is sent direct from the machine that produces it to the machine that
consumes it.

   In practice for this to be worthwhile the network you are using must
be fast enough to avoid becoming a bottleneck. For Pentium-III class
machines or above you will need a 100Mbps Ethernet.

   For really fast machines a switched 100MBps Ethernet (or better!) may
be needed.Setting up the rshd ("Remote Shell Daemon" needed for rsh to
do its work and configuring "rsh" is beyond the scope of this document,
but its a standard package and should be easily installed and activated
on any Linux or BSD distribution.

   Be aware that this is potentially a security issue so use with care
on machines that are visible to outside networks!

Interoperability
****************

   Quicktime files capturing using lavrec can be edited using
Broadcast2000.  But Broadcast2000 is not available any more on
heroinewarrior.  mjpeg AVI files captured using the streamer tool from
the xawtv package can be edited and compressed and played back using
software.  Hardware playback is not possible for such files due to
limitations in the Zoran hardware currently supported. Videos recorded
with NuppelVideo can also be processed with the mjpeg tools.

   If you have a Macintosh (MAC) and want to use the mjpeg tools look
there: http://www.sjoki.uta.fi/~shmhav/SVCD_on_a_Macintosh.txt and
http://homepage.mac.com/rnc/

   MPEG files produced using the tools are know to play back correctly
on:

   * dxr2 (hardware decoder card)

   * xine http://xine.sourceforge.net/

   * oms http://www.linuxvideo.org/

   * dvdview http://rachmaninoff.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/dvdview/

   * xmovie http://heroinewarrior.com/xmovie.php3

   * mplayer http://mplayer.sourceforge.net/

   * vlc http://www.videolan.org/

   * MPEG1 only: mtv http://www.mpegtv.com/

   * MPEG1 only: gtv
     http://packages.debian.org/stable/graphics/smpeg-gtv.html

   * MS Media player version 6 and 7

   * SW DVD Player

   To find out what you HW-player (most of the time DVD player) can do
take a look at: http://www.vcdhelp.com

   It seems that the MS Media player likes MPEG-1 streams more if you
have used -f 1 when multiplexing.

   If you have any problems or suggestions feel free to mail me
(Bernhard Praschinger): waldviertler@users.sourceforge.net There is a
lot of stuff added from the HINTS which Andrew Stevens (
andrew.stevens@nexgo.de ) created. Wolfgang Goeller checked the
document for bugs and spelling mistakes.

   And there a some people that helped me with program descriptions and
hints, `thanks'
