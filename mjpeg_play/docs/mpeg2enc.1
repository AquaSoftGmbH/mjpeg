.SH "DESCRIPTION"
mpeg2enc is heavily enhanced derivative of the MPEG Software
Simulation Group's MPEG-2 reference encoder.  It accepts streams in a
simple planar YUV format "YUV4MPEG" produced by the \fBlav2yuv\fP and
related filters (e.g. \fByuvscaler\fP(1)) from the \fBmjpegtools\fP(1)
package.  A output plug-in to the \fBmpeg2dec\fP(1) MPEG decoder is
available to permit its use in transcoding applications. The encoder
currently fully supports the generation of elementary MPEG-1,
progressive and interlaced frame MPEG-2 streams.  Field encoded MPEG-2
is also possible but is not currently maintained or supported.

For most purposes this elementary stream output will need to be
multiplexed with layer-II MPEG audio into a program/systems stream
using the
.BR mplex (1)
tool.

Note that although this manual page aims to explain how mpeg2enc can
be used effectively it is not intended as an introduction to MPEG-1/2
video which is a fairly complex topic in its own right.  The MPEG
video format is a somewhat baroque standard with many many options,
not all of which necessarily easy to explain or even particular useful
in the context of a software encoder.

Much useful practical information for novices can be found in the
mjpeg-HOWTO document that should have been installed with \fBmjpegtools\fP(1)
package.  Further information and useful supporting software can be found
on the mjpegtools web-site:

.SH "SELECTING THE MPEG PROFILE"
.BR -f\ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
Set the MPEG profile to use.  The MPEG standards support a vast number
of options.  In practice, different applications of the MPEG format place
additional constraints of the form the MPEG stream.   Setting this flag
selects the kind of stream to produce.
.IP
.BR 0 
- Generic MPEG1.  A basic MPEG-1 profile that lets most parameters
	be adjusted
	for particular applications using the other flags.  Typical
	applications would be to produce a variable bit-rate MPEG-1
	stream with big buffers and a high data-rate software playback
	on a computer.
.IP
.BR 1 
		- Standard VCD.  An MPEG1 profile exactly to the VCD2.0 specification.
		Flag settings that would result in a non-standard stream structure 
		are simply ignored.

.IP
.BR 2 
		- User VCD.  As for profile 2 but bit-rate and video buffer size can
		be set to non-standard values. Frame size may also be non-standard.
.IP
.BR 3
		- Generic MPEG2. A basic MPEG-1 profile that lets most parameters
	be adjusted
	for particular applications using the other flags.  Typical
	applications would be to produce a MPEG-2 stream with big buffers
	and long GOP's for software playback on a computer.

.IP
.BR 4
		- Standard VCD.  An MPEG-2 profile exactly to the SVCD2.0
		specification. Flag settings that would result in a
		non-standard stream structure are simply ignored.
.BR 5
		- Non-standard SVCD. As for profile 4 but bit-rate, video
		buffer size, GOP sizes and structure can be set to
		non-standard values. Frame size may also be non-standard.
.BR 6
		- VCD Stills sequence. Encodes the special style of MPEG stream
		used for still images on VCDs.  To use this profile you must
		set the target size you wish to compress the images to using the
		-T flag.   Reasonable values are around 35KB for standard resolution
		stills (352 wide) and 120KB for high resolution stills (704 wide).
.BR 7
		- VCD Stills sequence. Encodes the special style of MPEG stream
		used for still images on SVCDs.  Both standard (480 wide) and high
		resolution (704 wide) images are supported.
.BR 8
		- DVD MPEG-2. Just a very basic implementation.
.TP
.BI -T \ num

Set the target size for VCD still images in KB.

.SH "GENERAL FUNCTION LETTERS"
.TP
.BI -v \ num
Set verbosity level to num.  0 = warnings and errors only, 1 =
information as well, 2=really verbose.
.TP
.B -?
Display a synopsis of the command syntax.
.SH "FUNCTION LETTERS CONTROLLING OUTPUT STREAM STRUCTURE"

.TP
.BI -b \ num
The bit-rate of the output video stream in k Bits/sec.  The default is
exactly the bit-rate required for VCD streams. A sensible bit-rate to
set for SVCD is 2500.  If variable bit-rate mode has been selected (see the -q option) this
is the 
.I maximum
bit-rate of the stream.
.TP
.BI -V \ num
The maximum video buffer usage required to decode the stream in
KBytes.  The default is 46KB the (tiny) size specified for VCD.  The
size to use for SVCD is the (more reasonable) 230KB.  If you are
encoding for a half-decent software decoder it makes sense to push
this up to 500K or more.
.TP
.BR -q\ 2 .. 31
Minimum quantisation of the output stream.  Quantisation controls the
precision with which image information is encoded.  The lower the
number the higher the quality but the greater the required data-rate.
For VCD resolution anything below 8 or so produces pretty good quality
video.  For SVCD the equivalent level is around 10. If this option is
set a 
.I variable bit rate 
stream is produced.  This is more efficient
overall but variable bit-rate MPEG-1 cannot be played by many hardware
decoders and/or DVD/(S)VCD drives.  If you intend to use a software
decoder you'd be insane not to use variable bit-rate.

If this option is set without a maximum bit-rate being specified then
quantisation is fixed at the specified value.
.TP
.BR -I\ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
This sets the sequences picture structure and block encoding type for
MPEG-2 streams.  Setting 0 encodes frame-by-frame with support for
interlaced video turned off.  This is the most efficient option for
encoding material that is not interlaced (e.g. movies in PAL 25
frame/sec or NTSC 24 frames/sec in 3:2 pulldown format).  However, it
produces rotten results for interlaced video material.  For such
material use -F 3 which encodes frame-by-frame with interlace-adapted
motion compensation and block encoding.  Setting 1 or 2 will encode
field-by-field (2 is "top field first", 3 is "bottom field first").
Its use is deprecated as implementation is somewhat less refined than
frame-by-frame and results, even if implemented to the same level, are
inferior.
.IP
It should be noted that encoding -F 3 takes appreciably longer than -F 0.
.TP
.B -p
Setting -p only makes sense for 24frame/sec Movie source material.  It sets
flags in the output stream that tell the decoder to play the movie as
NTSC 60field/sec video using "3:2 pulldown".  This is vastly more
efficient than encoding as 60field/sec video.  The classic application
is to transcode a PAL-encoded movie (24fps played too fast at 25 fps!)
into NTSC (see the -f flag).
.TP
.BI -g " num " -G \ num
These flags set the minimum and maximum group-of-picture (GOP) size
for the output MPEG stream.  By default both are set to 12 to suit VCD
encoding.  If the two values are not identical mpeg2enc applies a
simple scene-change detection procedure to try to select GOP sizes
that ensure big changes of image coincide with the fully-encoded
I-frame starting a new GOP.  This can help prevent transient
"blockiness".  For SVCD the largest GOP size is 15 for PAL or 18 for
NTSC.  Reasonable minimum GOP sizes are 6 or 9.  A larger GOP size can
help reduce the bit-rate required for a given quality.  However, this
really only applies to high-quality source material with little noise
(e.g. digital video).  For broadcast material there is little point
setting GOP size much beyond 21 or 24.  Even with good source material
diminishing returns set in quite rapidly.

Note: Mpeg2enc is currently hard-wired to produce 2 B frames between
each I/P frame unless the GOP size forces less.  This is reasonable
for medium to high bit-rates (>= 1Mbps) but probably sub-optimal for
low-bit-rate encoding.
.TP
.BI -P
	This flag forces the GOP size selection to choose sizes 
	that ensure 2 B frames appear between adjacent I/P frames.
	Several common MPEG-1 decoders can't handle streams where less than
	2 B-frames appear between I/P frames.
.TP
.BR -Q\ 0.0 .. 4.0 
This flag sets the amount quantisation is reduced for
blocks containing unusually large amounts of sharp image detail.
Setting this value 0.0 produces the most efficient use of bits but may
cause visible/artefacting around detailed sections.  A larger value
may help suppress artefacts, however, on noisy source material this may cause
a "swimming" effect on textured backgrounds as the noise cause blocks to
be boosted at random.  The default is 1.0 (which is actually pretty mild)
if swimminess occurs turn set to 0.0.
.TP
.B -s
This flag forces the encoder to generate a "sequence header" at the start
of every group-of-pictures.  This is needed by some player hardware to
support fast forward/rewind/random access functions but is a waste of bits
otherwise.
.SH "OPTION LETTERS CONTROLLING FORMAT OF DECODED VIDEO"
.TP
.BR -n\ n | p | s
Force the input stream to be treated as NTSC|PAL|SECAM regardless of
what the stream header might suggest.  Basically this just sets the
defaults for a bunch of other options.
.TP
.BI -f \ num
Set the frame-rate of the output-stream.  Currently only the standard
MPEG rates are supported.  Eventually more-or-less arbitrary rates
will be possible.
.br
 0 - illegal
.br
 1 - 24000.0/1001.0 (NTSC 3:2 pulldown converted FILM)

.TP
.BI -a \ num
Set the playback aspect ratio code of the encoded video.
.br
 1 - 1  - 1:1 display
.br
 2 - 2  - 4:3 display
.br
 3 - 3  - 16:9 display
.br
 4 - 4  - 2.21:1 display
.IP
For MPEG-2 the specified aspect ratios are used directly. For MPEG-1
mpeg2enc infers the MPEG-1 pixel aspect code from the video norm
specified and the specified playback aspect ratio.

.SH "OPTION LETTERS FOR QUALITY TUNING"
.TP
.BI -r \ num
This flag sets the motion compensation search radius.  For most
purposes the default (16) should be just fine.  For high-resolution
MPEG-2 and active scenes it may be worth bumping it up.  However, this
will make encoding significantly slower.  There is little point
reducing the radius.  Speed gains are not huge and the impact on quality
can be marked.
.TP
.BR -4 | -2\ 1 .. 4
These options control how radical the encoder is in throwing away
apparently poor candidate blocks during motion compensation.  A
setting of 1 means very few blocks are discarded early which makes for
slow encoding but quality as good as it gets a setting of 4 makes for
fast encoding but can impact quality.  The -4 flag controls discarding
during the initial 4*4 search stage, the -2 flag controls discarding
during the secondary 2*2 stage.  
.IP
These flags are useful as the speed quality trade-off is markedly
different depending on which CPU you have.  On modern machines the
impact of speed is around a factor 2 on older machines a factor 3.
The impact on quality is around 10% quantisation (0.2 of a bit of
precision in encoding textures).  For most purposes the default
settings will be fine.  However on P-III Katmai etc -4 2 -2 1 gives a
good near-optimum quality setting with reasonably speed.
.TP
.B  -N
Setting this flag adjusts the way texture detail is quantised to
reduce the maount of high-frequency information encoded. This is very
useful for 
.I mildy
noisy sources.  If you have really noisy material the filtering tools
available in mjpegtools are a much better bet.
.TP
.B -h
Setting this flag makes the encoder encode as much high-frequency information
as possible.   This is a good setting for maximising quality at VCD
resolution with good quality low-noise source material.  It can also help
with "swimmy" material if you can spare the bit-rate!
.SH "OPTION LETTERS FOR CHUNKING THE OUTPUT STREAM"
.TP
.BI -S \ num
This flag allows the target size of individual sequences in the final
multiplexed stream to be set in MBytes. If set  mpeg2enc keeps track
of how large the eventual stream is likely to be and inserts a sequence
split (actually: sequence end / sequence start) into the output stream
each time it reaches the specified limit.  The multiplexor \fBmplex\fP(1) can
recognise these splits and start a new multiplexed output file each time
it encounters one.   In this way it is easy to automatically ensure
each component sequence file can be burnt onto a CD-R and still be
played as a stand-alone MPEG sequence.
.TP
.BI -B \ num
Since mpeg2enc can't read minds it cannot know in advance what other
material will be multiplexed with the output video stream.  Thus to
get its calculations of where to insert split point right it needs to be
told the combined data-rate of the other material that is eventually to
be multiplexed with the video.
This flag allows this rate to be specified in K bits/sec.
.SH "SSE, 3D-Now!, MMX"
mpeg2enc makes extensive use of these SIMD instruction set extension
on x86 family CPU's.  The routines used are determined dynamically at
run-time.  It should be noted that using SSE requires operating system
support.  Old 2.2.x Linux kernels (unless patched ones like RedHat) do
not have this and so SSE, although physically present, won't be activated.
.SH "BUGS"
There should be an option to force GOP sizes that permit 2 B frames
between I/P frames.  Some decoders (even software)  can't handle the case
where I/P frames come back to back or with only 1 B frame between them.

There really should be some kind of dynamic noise-reduction algorithm
someplace in the mpegtools tool chain.

There needs to be a facility for writing dummy user-data fields so
that the multiplexer/imager can insert forward/backward pointers when
muxing/imaging an SVCD.

Is there some kind soul out there with source-code for a good SSE
(not MMX) DCT and iDCT?
