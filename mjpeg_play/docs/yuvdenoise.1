.SH NAME
yuvdenoise \- Motion-Compensating-YUV4MPEG2-frame-denoiser

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yuvdenoise
.RI [ options ]
.RI "</dev/stdin >/dev/stdout"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fByuvdenoise\fP is a spatio\-temporal noise\-filter for
YUV4MPEG2 streams. This is useful to reduce the bitrate       
needed to encode your captured movies for VCD and SVCD creation.

.SH OPTIONS
\fByuvdenoise\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 4
.BI \-s " y,u,v [0..255] Spatial noise-filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for the spatial noise filter.
If you set this too high expect the image to be blurred.  Reducing the
Y' (y) value to 2 will preserve more detail but still remove noise.
.br
(default=2,4,4)

.TP 4
.BI \-g " y,u,v [0..255] Gaussian blur mixing levels"
The default values for the chroma (Cb/u, Cr/v) are sane and changing them
is only recommended if the chroma is not noisy.  Setting the Y' (y) value
too high will lose much detail and make a very blurry image.  To preserve
detail in the image a Y' (y) value of 64 or less is recommended.  A value
of 0 disables gaussian blur processing for the specific component (0,0,0
completely disables the gaussian blur).
.br
(default=32,255,255)

.TP 4
.BI \-m " y,u,v [0..255] 3D Median filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for the 3D median filter.
.br
(default=2,4,4)

.TP 4
.BI \-r " y,u,v [0..255] Renoising filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for adding random \"noise\" back into the video stream.
Default is disabled (not adding random noise).
.br
(default=0,0,0)

.TP 4
.BI \-t " y,u,v [0..255] Temporal noise\-filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for the temporal noise\-filter.
Values above 12 may introduce ghosting.  The default value for Y' (y)
is often a little high and reducing it to 4 or 5 may be necessary.  If the
chroma smears or ghosts try using values of 5 or 6 instead of the default (12).
A value of 0 disables temporal filtering for the specified component (0,0,0
disables all temporal filtering).
.br
(default=4,8,8)

.SH HOW IT WORKS
To Be Written (maybe) in the future.

.SH TYPICAL USAGE AND TIPS
As it is self-adapting to the noise-situation found in the stream you
normally just can go without any options set:

lav2yuv my-video.avi | yuvdenoise | mpeg2enc -t 1 -o my-video.m1v
