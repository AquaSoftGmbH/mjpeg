.SH NAME
yuvfps \- Converts to a different frame rate

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yuvfps 
.RB [ -r 
.IR Num:Den ]
.RB [ -s 
.IR Num:Den ]
.RB [ -c ]
.RB [ -v\ 0 - 2 ]
.RB [ -h ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fByuvfps\fP is a general (UP or DOWN) resampling utility that is provided to
allow the generation of video streams with the frame rates required for each
standard video format. \fByuvfps\fP reads a YUV4MPEG stream from the standard
input and outputs a YUV4MPEG stream to the standard output in which frames from
the original ones are skipped (downsampling) or duplicated (upsampling).
This allows for other mjpegtools that require a specific frame rate to 
process the stream.

\fByuvfps\fP uses Bresenham's algorithm to do the resampling so that the new
video stream is similar to the original one. Note, however, that downscaling
is a non-reversible operation because frames are dropped. Moreover, the resulting
video stream may not have the exact same duration as the original one if the
new frame rate is not a whole multiple of the original rate.
  
\fByuvfps\fP also can "fix" the framerate specified in the YUV4MPEG header. 
This allows for the generation of effects (fast-forwarding, slow motion) and
also when the source stream has some framerate that is very close, but not 
exactly, the rate required for some standard video (for example, 24.9 vs 25). 

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 
.B -r \fBNum:Den\fP
.IP
Specifies the resulting stream frame rate.
.TP 
.B -c 
.IP
Changes the stream header frame rate in the output stream, but copies withouth
changing the frames from the original stream. with the -r option you tell yuvfps which framerate should be set. 

.TP 
.B -s \fBNum:Den\fP
.IP
Ignores the frame rate in the input stream and assumes this frame rate for the 
input stream.
