.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fByuvmedianfilter\fP is designet to enhance/filter images. It takes the input of STDIN and take the output do STDOUT.  
.br
This filter look around the current point for a radius and averages this values that fall inside a threshold.
So the image is softend and the edges become more sharp. If the input material is noisy (it is always noisy but you do not always see it) the images are better.
The encoder spends less bandwith for encoding artefactes for the source.
The more sophisticated version of image filtering is yuvdenoise. But you can use both programms in the encoding procces.
It cannot procces a recorded file and write the improved version to a other file. 

.SH "OPTIONS"

.SH BUGS
yuvmedianfilter produces at some image sizes a vertical green bar on the left and right side of the image. These bars are 4 pixles wide. 
If you do not want this bar, you can remove it with yuvscaler's -I ACTIVE_ option.
