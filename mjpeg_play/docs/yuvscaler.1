.SH NAME
yuvscaler \- downscales arbitrary sized yuv frames (stdin by default) to a
specified format (to stdout)
.SH SYNOPSIS
yuvscaler -I [input_keyword] -M [mode_keyword] -O [output_keyword] [-n
p|s|n] |-v 0-2] [-h] [inputfiles]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fByuvscaler\fP is a general downscaling utility that is provided to make
conversion between various current video format easy. It is usually followed
by encoding by mpeg2enc. \fByuvscaler\fP may convert the film you have recorded 
with your camcorder, or with your TV-card, or extracted from your DVD, to frames
that are suitable for VCD or SVCD burning. 
\fByuvscaler\fP will automatically take into account PAL/SECAM and NTSC format, 
as well as widescreen (16:9) format and interlacing. Use of yuvscaler was designed to be
straithforward.

3 typical uses will be:

\fBVCD conversion:\fP yuvscaler -O VCD my-file.mjpeg | mpeg2enc -o my-file.vcd

\fBSVCD conversion:\fP yuvscaler -O SVCD my-file.mjpeg | mpeg2enc -m 2 -F 3 -o my-file.svcd

\fBWidescreen transcoding to VCD:\fP yuvscaler -M WIDE2VCD my-file-in-16:9.mjpeg | mpeg2enc -o my-file.vcd
.SH OPTIONS
\fByuvscaler\fP is keyword driven

inputfiles selects yuv frames coming from Editlist files
 
\fB-I\fP for keyword concerning INPUT  frame characteristics

\fB-M\fP for keyword concerning the downscaling MODE of yuvscaler

\fB-O\fP for keyword concerning OUTPUT frame characteristics

((the former syntax with -k and -w is still supported but depreciated))

.TP 4
Possible \fBinput keyword\fP are:

\fBUSE_WidthxHeight+WidthOffset+HeightOffset\fP to select a useful area of the input frame (multiple of 4) the rest of the image being discarded
	  
if frames come from stdin, interlacing type is not known from header. Therefore, they are taken as non-interlaced by default. To change this, use:

\fBINTERLACED_ODD_FIRST\fP  to select an interlaced, odd  first frame input stream from stdin

\fBINTERLACED_EVEN_FIRST\fP to select an interlaced, even first frame input stream from stdin
.TP 4
Possible \fBmode keyword\fP are:

\fBWIDE2STD\fP to converts widescreen (16:9) input frames into standard output (4:3), generating necessary black lines

\fBRATIO_WidthIn_WidthOut_HeightIn_HeightOut\fP to specified downscaling ratios of WidthIn/WidthOut for width and HeightIN/HeightOut for height to
be applied to the useful area. The output active area that results from
dowscaling the input useful area might be different from the display area
specified thereafter using the -O KEYWORD syntax In that case, ./yuvscaler will automatically generate necessary
black lines and columns and/or skip necessary lines and columns to get an active output centered with the
display size

\fBWIDE2VCD\fP to transcode wide (16:9) frames  to VCD (equivalent to -M WIDE2STD -O VCD)

\fBFAST_WIDE2VCD\fP to transcode full sized wide (16:6) frames to VCD (equivalent to -M WIDE2STD -M RATIO_2_1_2_1 -O VCD, see after)
.TP 4
Possible \fBoutput keywords\fP are:

\fBMONOCHROME\fP to generate monochrome frames on output

\fBVCD\fP to generate  VCD compliant frames on output (taking care of PAL
and NTSC standards, not-interlaced frames)

\fBSVCD\fP to generate SVCD compliant frames on output (taking care of PAL and NTSC standards, even interlaced frames)

\fBSIZE_WidthxHeight\fP to generate frames of size WidthxHeight on output (multiple of 4)

If you wish to specify interlacing of output frames, use:

\fBINTERLACED_ODD_FIRST\fP  to select an interlaced, odd  first frame output stream

\fBINTERLACED_EVEN_FIRST\fP to select an interlaced, even first frame output stream

\fBNON_INTERLACED\fP to select not interlaced output frames

By default, regarding interlacing, output frames are considered of the same kind as input frames
.TP 4
The most useful downscaling ratios receive a dedicated and accelerated treatment. They are:

RATIO_WidthIn_WidthOut_1_1 => downscaling only concerns width, not height

RATIO_3_2_1_1 => SVCD downscaling

RATIO_1_1_HeightIn_HeightOut => downscaling only concerns height, not width

RATIO_1_1_4_3 => WIDE2STD downscaling mode

RATIO_WidthIn_WidthOut_2_1 => VCD downscaling

RATIO_2_1_2_1 => slightly width distorted (reale ratio 45 to 22) but faster VCD downscaling (-M RATIO_2_1_2_1 -O VCD)

RATIO_WidthIn_WidthOut_8_3 => specific to WIDE2VCD downscaling (-M WIDE2STD -O VCD)

RATIO_2_1_8_3 => specific to (slighly distorted) FAST_WIDE2VCD downscaling (-M WIDE2STD -M RATIO_2_1_2_1 -O VCD)

RATIO_1_1_1_1 => copy useful input part of possible several files into output frames
.TP 0
\fB-n\fP  if necessary, specifies the OUTPUT norm for VCD/SVCD p=pal,s=secam,n=ntsc

\fB-v\fP  Specifies the degree of verbosity: 0=quiet, 1=normal, 2=verbose/debug

\fB-h\fP  print this lot!
