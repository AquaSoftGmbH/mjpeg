INTRODUCTION
=====================================
I wrote this things down, because i had many sheets with notes on them.
This should be some kind of summay of collected knowledge of this sheets.
Andrew Stevens helped with encoding and VCD kowledge and hints.

Achtung es gibt auch eine deutsche Version bei:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpeg

You have to compile and install the mjpeg_play package for this read the
README & INSTALL.

There is a script in the scripts/ directory. This script is something that
show's you a way how it can be done. It also creates (under certain 
circumstances) videos that look quite good. But better videos you only get 
by tuning the parameter's youself.

For more information about the programms read the coresponding manpage.
If not installed they are in the docs directory and use: man -l lavrec.1
If installed use : man mjpegtools

RECORDING VIDEOS
=====================================
You will usually have to load the drivers for the Buz or DC10(+) or LML33
cards. So you have to run the update script providing as option the name 
of your card you have. The script is usually in /usr/src/driver-zoran/

If you compile the tools on a P6 based computer (PPro, P-II, P-III, P-4,
Athlon,Duron) then never try to let them run on a P5 based computer 
(Pentium, Pentium-MMX, K6, K6-x, Cyrix, Via, Winchip). You'll get a 
"illegal instruction" and the programm won't work.

Start xawtv to see if you get an picture. If you want to use HW-playback of
the recorded streams you have to start xawtv (any TV application works) 
once to get the streams played back. You should also check the settings of 
your mixer in the sound card.

Recording with lavrec look's like this:
>lavrec -f a -i P -d 2 record.avi

Should start recording now,
-f a: use AVI as output format,
-i P: use as input source the SVHS-In with PAL format,
-d 2: the size of the pictures are half size (352x288)
record.avi: name of the created file.
Recording is finished by pressing Crtl-C (nowadays: Strg-C).

Other example:
>lavrec -f q -i n -d 1 -q 80 -s -l 80 -R l -U record.mov

Should start recording now,
-f q : use Quicktime as output format,
-i n : use Composit-In with NTSC format,
-d 1 : record pictures with full size (720x576)
-q 80: set the quality to 80% of the captured image
-s   : use stereo mode (default mono)
-l 80: set the recording level to 80% of the max during recording
-R l : set the recording source to Line-In
-U   : With this lavrec usese the read instead of mmap for recording this 
is needed if your sound card does not support the mmap for recording. 


Other example:
>lavrec -w -f a -i S -d 2 -l -1 record%02d.avi
Should start recoding:
-w   : Waits for user confirmation to start (press enter)
-f a : use AVI as output format,
-i S : use SECAM SVHS-Input (SECAM Composit recording is also possible: -i s)
-d 2 : the size of the pictures are half size
-l -1: do not touch the mixer settings.
record%02d.avi : Here lavrec creates the first file named record00.avi after 
the file has reached a size of 1.6GB (after about 20 Minutes recording) it 
starts a new sequence named record01.avi and so on, till the recording is 
stopped, or the disk ist full. 

Other example:
lavrec -f a -i t -q 80 -d 2 -C europe-west:SE20 test.avi
Should start recording now,
-f a : use AVI as output format,
-i t : use tuner input
-q 80: set the quality to 80% of the captured image
-d 2 : the size of the pictures are half size (352x288)
-C ..: choose TV channels, and the corresponding -it and -iT 
(video source: TV tuner) can currently be used on the Marvel G200/G400 and 
the Matrox Millenium G200/G400 with Rainbow Runner extension (BTTV-Support 
is under construction).  For more information on how to make the TV tuner 
parts of these cards work, see the Marvel/Linux project on: 
http://marvel.sourceforge.net .

Last example:
lavrec -f a -i p -d 2 -q 80 -s -l 70 -R l --software-encoding test03.avi
The only not known option is --software-encoding, this enables the software
encoding of the recorded images. With this option you can also record from
a bttv based card. The processor load is high. It also works with zoran based
cards but only with -d 4.

All lavtools accept the %02d file description, so you do not have to name each 
file, but that would also be a posibillity to do. 

Note: More options are described in the lavrec.c file or take a look at the
man-page.

There are more options, but with this you should be able to start.

How about some hints as to sensible settings. I habitually turn quality to
80% or more for -d 2 capture. At full resolution as low as 40% seems to be
visually "perfect".  -d 2 is already better than VHS video (a *lot*!).
If you're aiming to create VCD's then there is little to be gained recording
at full resolution as you need to reduce to -d 2 resolution later anyway.


CHECKING IF RECORDING WAS SUCCESFUL
=====================================
You can use lavplay or xlav.

>lavplay -p S record.avi

You should see the recorded video and hear the sound. But the decoding of the
video is done by the CPU. You system has quit a heavy load. You don't need
xawtv or anything, though.

The better way:
>lavplay -p H record.avi

The the video is decoded and played by the hardware. The system load is now
very low. This will play it back on-screen using the hardware.

You might also try:
>lavplay -p C record.avi

Which will play it back using the hardware, but to the output of the card, so
you'll be able to use xawtv or another tv application to see the results.
NOTE: ALWAYS first open xawtv, and only then, start lavplay -p C. If you do it
the other way around, the computer might crash.

>glav record.avi

Does the same as lavplay, but you have an nice gui. The options for glav and 
lavplay are nearly the same.

Using hardware playback a signal for the Composit and SVHS OUT is generated, so you can view the movie on your TV.

NOTE: After loading the driver's you have to start xawtv to set up some things
lavplay and glav do not, but they are needed for HW-Playback. Don't forget to
close xawtv !!
NOTE2: Do not try to send glav an lavplay into background, wont work correct !!!
NOTE3: SECAM playback is now (12.3.2001) only in monochrome, but the recording
and encoding is done right.

Coming soon: There is a tool, that makes recording videos very simple named
Linux Video Studio. You can download it at: http://ronald.bitfreak.net


EDIT THE VIDEO
=====================================

Most of tasks can be easily done by glav or by lavplay.
Like deleting parts of the video, cut paste and copy parts of the videos.
I for my term, I was not in the need of doing anything that glav coudn't do.

The modification's should be saved because glav does not edit (not destuctive)
the video. This means that the video is left untouced, an the modification's
are keept in an extra "Edit List" file. Readable with a text editor. This files
can be used as an input file for the lavtools, like lav2wav, lav2yuv, lavtrans.

If you want to cut off the beginning and the end of the stream mark the
beginning and the and, and use the "save select" button. The edit list file is
than used as input for the lavtools. If you want to split on recorded video to
some samler one simply select the parts and then save each part to a differnt
listfile.

You can see all changes to the video and sound NOW, you do not need to
recalculate something.

If you want to get an "destructive" version of your edited video use:
>lavtrans -o short_version.avi -f a editlist.eli

-o    : specifies the output name
-f a  : specifies the output format (AVI for example)
editlist.eli : is the list file where the modifications are descibed. You
generate the list file with the "save all" or "save select" buttons in xlav.

Unify videos:

> lavtrans -o stream.movtar -f m record_1.avi record_2.avi ... record_n.avi
-o  : specifies the output name
-f m: specifies the output format, movtar in this case

This is usually not necessary. Keep in your mind that there is the 2GB limit of
files in the ext2 filesystem.

Separate pics and sound: 

> lavtrans -o sound.wav -f w stream.avi
Creates an wav file with the sound of the stream.avi
Maybe need if you want to remove noise or something else, or you want to
convert it to an an other sound format for other use.

An other version of spliting the sound is:
> lav2wav editlist.eli > sound.wav

Creating seperate images:
> mkdir jpg
> lavtrans -o jpg/image%05d.jpg -f i stream.avi
First create the directory "jpg".
Then lavtrans will create single JPG images in the jpg directory from the
stream.avi file. The files will be named: image00000.jpg image00001.jpg ....

Maybe interresting if you need sample images and do not want to play arround
with grabing an single image.


CREATING MOVIE TRANSITIONS
=====================================
Thanks to pHilipp Zabel's lavpipe, we can now make simple transitions between
movies or combine multiple layers of movies.

pHilipp wrote this HOWTO on how to make transitions:

Let's assume simple this scenery: We have two input videos, intro.avi
and epilogue.mov and want make intro.avi transist into epilogue.mov
with a duration of one second (that is 25 frames for PAL or 30 frames
for NTSC).

intro.avi and epiloque.mov have to be of the same format regarding
frame rate and image resolution, at the moment.
In this example they are both 352x288 PAL files. intro.avi contains
250 frames and epilogue.mov is 1000 frames long.

Therefore our output file will contain:
 - the first 225 frames of intro.avi
 - a 25 frame transistion containing the last 25 frames of intro.avi
   and the first 25 frames of epilogue.mov
 - the last 975 frames of epilogue.mov

We could get the last 25 frames of intro.avi by calling:
>lav2yuv -o 225 -f 25 intro.avi
-o 225, the offset, tells lav2yuv to begin with frame # 225
and -f 25 makes it output 25 frames from there on
Another possibility is:
>lav2yuv -o -25 intro.avi
Since negative offsets are counted from the end.

And the first 25 frames of epilogue.mov:
>lav2yuv -f 25 epilogue.mov
-o defaults to an offset of zero

But we need to combine the two streams with lavpipe. So the call would be:
>lavpipe "lav2yuv -o 255 -f 25 intro.avi" "lav2yuv -f 25 epilogue.mov"
The output of this is a raw yuv stream that can be fed into
transist.flt.

transist.flt needs to be informed about the duration of the transistion
and the opacity of the second stream at the beginning and at the end
of the transistion:
 -o num   opacity of second input at the beginning [0-255]
 -O num   opacity of second input at the end [0-255]
 -d num   duration of transistion in frames
An opacity of 0 means that the second stream is fully transparent
(only stream one visible), at 255 stream two is fully opaque.
In our case the correct call (transistion from stream 1 to stream 2)
would be:
>transist.flt -o 0 -O 255 -d 25
The -s and -n parameters equal to the -o and -f parameters of lav2yuv
and are only needed if anybody wants to render only a portion of the
transistion for whatever reason. Please note that this only affects
the weighting calculations - none of the input is really skipped, so
that if you pass the skip parameter (-s 30, for example), you also
need to skip the first 30 frames in lav2yuv (-o 30) in order to get
the expected result. If you didn't understand this, send an email to
the authors or simply ignore -s and -n.
The whole procedure will be automated later, anyway.

Now we want to compress the yuv stream with yuv2lav.
>yuv2lav -f a -q 80 -o transistion.avi
Reads the yuv stream from stdin and outputs an avi file (-f a)
with compressed jpeg frames of quality 80.

Now we have the whole command for creating a transistion:

>ypipe "lav2yuv -o 255 -f 25 intro.avi" "lav2yuv -f 25 epilogue.mov" | \
transist.flt -o 0 -O 255 -d 25 | yuv2lav -f a -q 80 -o transistion.avi

(This is one line.) The resulting video can be written as a LAV Edit List,
a plain text file containing the following lines:

LAV Edit List
PAL
3
intro.avi
transistion.avi
epilogue.mov
0 0 224
1 0 24
2 25 999

This file can be fed into xlav or lavplay, or you can pipe it into mpeg2enc
with lav2yuv or combine the whole stuff into one single mjpeg file with
lavtrans or lav2yuv|yuv2lav.



CONVERTING THE STREAM TO MPEG VIDEOS
=====================================
If you want a one command conversation to mpeg videos try lav2mpeg
in the scripts directory.

However, better results can be accomplished by trying out various options
and find out which one works best for you.


CREATING SOUND
=====================================
MPEG-1 videos need MPEG1-layer2 sound files, for MPEG-2 videos you can use
MPEG1-Layer2 and MPEG1-Layer3 (MP3). But you should stick to MPEG1-Layer2,
because most of the MPEG2 player (DVD Player for example, usually the
different Winxx Versions have great problems with this too) are not able to
play MPEG2-Video an MPEG1-Layer3 sound.

Example:
> lav2wav stream.avi stream1.avi | mp2enc -o sound.mp2

This creates a mpeg-2 sound file out of the stream.avi with 224kBit/sec
bitrate. You can specifie more files, and also us the placeholder %nd.
Where n describes the numbers. 

Example:
> lav2wav editlist.eli | mp2enc -b 128 -m -o sound.mp2

This creates an mono output with an bitrate of 128kBit/sec bitrate.
The input this time is the editlistfile (can have any name) created with xlav,
so all changes you made in xlav are direct proccesed and handed over to mp2enc.
So you do NOT have to create an edited stream with lavtrans to get it converted
properly.

Another example:
> cat sound.wav | mp2enc -v 2 -V -o sound.mp2

This creates an VCD (-V bitrate=224, stero, sampling rate:44100) compatible
output from the wav file.
With -v 2 mp2enc is more verbose, while encoding you see the sec of audio already encodet.

The toolame encoder is also able to produce an Layer2 file. You can use that
one as well.

You can test the output with:
> plaympeg sound.mp2

NOTE: plaympeg is an MPEG1 Player for Linux, you can use other players as well,
for MPEG audio testing you can also use mpg123.



CONVERTING VIDEO
=====================================
You can create MPEG1 and MPEG2 videos.

Normaly the first video you create is not the best, for optimal quality/size
you need to play with the bitrate, search radius, noise filter ....
The options of mpeg2enc are described in the README in the mpeg2enc directory.

Example:
> lav2yuv stream.avi | mpeg2enc -o video.m1v

This creates an video file with the default bitrate of 1152kBit/sec. This is
the bitrate that you need if you want to create VCD's.

Example:
> lav2yuv -d 2 stream%02d.avi | mpeg2enc -b 1500 -r 16 -o video.m1v

There lav2yuv drops the 2 lsb (Less Significant Byte) of the each pixel. Then
mpeg2enc creates a video with a bitrate of 1500kBit/s uses an search radius of
16. That when trying to find similar 16*16 macroblocks of pixels in between
frames the encoder looks up to 16 pixels away from the current position of
each block.  It looks twice as far when comparing frames 1 frame apart and so
on. Reasonable values are 16 or 24. With the file description of stream%02d.avi
all files are procced that match this pattern beginning with 00, 01....

Example:
> lav2yuv -n 1 editlist.eli | mpeg2enc -b 2000 -r 24 -q 6 -o video.m1v

There lav2yuv applies an low-pass noise filter to the images. Then mpeg2enc
creates an video with an maximal bitrate of 2000kBit/s (or 2000000Bit/s) but
the -q flag activates the variable bitrate and an quality factor of 6.
It also uses an search radius of 24. Here is also the editlistfile used.

Explanation:
when mpeg2enc is invoked without the 'q' flag it creates "constant bit-rate"
MPEG streams.  Where (loosely speaking) the strength of compression (and hence
picture quality) is adjusted to ensure that on average each frame of video has
exactly the specified number of bits.  Such constant bit-rate streams are
needed for broadcasting and for low-cost hardware like DVD and VCD players
which use slow fixed-speed player hardware.

Obviously, this is fairly inefficient as it means inactive scenes use up bits
that could better be "spent" on rapidly changing scenes.  Setting the q flag
tells mpeg2enc to generate variable bit-rate streams.  For such streams the
bit-rate specified is simply the maximum permissible.  The q parameter
specifies the minimum degree of compression to be applied by specifying 
how exactly picture information is recorded..  Typically, q would be set 
so that quiet scenes would use less than the specified maximum (around 6 
or 8) but fast moving scenes would still be bit-rate limited.  For 
archival purposes setting a maximum bit-rate high enough never to be 
reached (e.g. 10Mbps) and a q of 2 or 3 are reasonable choices.

Example:
> lav2yuv -a 352x240+0+21 stream.avi | mpeg2enc -b 1152 -r 16 -4 1 -2 1 -o video.m1v

Usually there is at the top and at the bottom a nearly black border, and a lot
of bandwith ist used for something you do not like. The -a option sets
everything that is not in the described area to black, but the imagesize 
(352x288) is not changed.
So you have a real black border, the encoder only uses a few bits for encoding
them, you are still compatibel to VCD's for this example.
The -4 1 and -2 1 options improve the quality about 10% , but conversion is
slower.

At the size of: 352x288 (1/2 PAL size, created when using the -d 2 option when
recording) the needed bitrate is/should be between 1000 - 1500kBit/s.

But anyways, the major factor is quality of the original and the degree of
filtering. Poor quality unfiltered material typically needs a higher rate 
to avoid visible artefacts.
If you want to reduce bit-rate without annoying artefacts when compressing
broadcast material you should try the noise filters. This are for lav2yuv: 
-n [0..2] and -d [0..3], there are other filter,they are described later.

Example:
> lav2yuv stream.avi | mpeg2enc -b 1500 -n s -g 5 -G 20 -o video.m1v
Here the stream.avi will be encoded with:
-b 1500    : a Bitrate of 1500kBit/sec
-n s       : the input Video norm is forced to SECAM
-g 6 -G 20 : the encoder can dynamically size the output streams groups-of-
pictures to reflect scene changes. This is done by setting a maximum GOP 
(-G flag) size larger than the minimum (-g flag).
For VCD's sensible values might be a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 15. For
SVCD 9 and 18 would be good values. If you only want to play it back on SW 
player you can use other min-max values.

Example: 
> lav2yuv -n 1 -a 352x220+0+34 stream%02d.avi | mpeg2enc -b 1500 -r 16 -4 1 \
> -2 1 -S 630 -B 260 -o video_n1_1500_r16_41_21_S630_B240.m1v

Here lav2yuv uses the low pass filter for optimizeing the pictures, also the a
part top and bottom border are set to black. lav2yuv processes all the stream
files. Then mpeg2enc uses some options that make the encoded stream look nicer.
But mpeg2enc also mark the stream so that mplex generates after 630MB a new 
stream is begun. But the imprtant thing that this works is that you specifie 
with the -B option the non video (audio and mplex information) bitrate. 260 
should be fine for audio with 224kBit and mplex information. For further 
information take a look at the encoding scripts in the scripts directory.

Scaling:
using yuvscaler, one can now also scale the video before encoding it. This can
be useful for, for example, users with a DC10+ card, which captures at 
384x288 (PAL/SECAM) or 640x480 (NTSC) when using full resolution with
decimation two during recording.

You get a full description of all commands starting:
> yuvscaler -h

> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvscaler -O VCD | mpeg2enc -o video.m1v
This will rescale the 384x288 or 768x576 (PAL/SECAM) or 320x240 or 640x480
(NTSC) stream to the VCD-size 352x288 (PAL/SECAM) or 352x240 (NTSC) and
encode the resulting output YUV data to an mpeg stream.

It can also do SVCD-scaling to 480x480 (NTSC) or 480x567 (PAL/SECAM):
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvscaler -O SVCD -M BICUBIC | mpeg2enc -o video.m2v

The mode keyword (-M) forces yuvscaler to use the higher quality bicubic
algorithmus for downscaling and not the default resample algorithmus. 
Upscaling is always done by the bicubic algorithmus.

Other Example
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvscaler -I USE_450x340+20+30 -O SIZE_320x200 | 
> mpeg2enc -o video.m1v 

Here we only use a part of the input, and have special output format. 

Testing is done by:
> plaympeg video.m1v

Note: This are only examples there are more options you can use, you can use
most of them together, to create high quality videos, with the lowest 
possible bitrate. 
Note2: The higher you set the search radius, the longer the converstation will 
take. In common you can say the more options used the longer it takes. 
Note3: MPEG1 was not designed to be a VBR (variable bitrate stream) !!
So if you encode with -q 15 mpeg2enc sets the maximal bitrate -b to 1152.
If you want a VBR MPEG1 you have to set -b very high (2500).
Note4: Maybe you should give better names than video.m1v . 
A good idea would be if you see the filename you know the options you've used. 
(Ex: video_b1500_r16_41_21.m1v) 
An other possibility is to call all the layer 2 files ".mp2" all the MPEG-1 
video files ".m1v" and all MPEG-2 video files ".m2v".  Easy to see what's 
happening then.
And reserve .mpg for multiplexed MPEG-1/2 streams.

OPTIMIZING THE STREAM:
=====================================

Using Filters helps to increase the image Quality on fixes bitrate streams. Or reduces the filesize when using varibale Bitrate Streams. 

Example:
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvmedianfilter | mpeg2enc -o video.m1v
Here the yuvmedianfilter programm is used enhance the image. This has the 
effect of remove some of low freqence noice in the images. It also sharpens 
the image a little. It takes a center pointer avg the pixels around it that 
fall with the threshold. It then replaces the center pixel with this new 
value. You can also use the -r (radius) option for an other search radius 
, and -t is used to control the threshold of what pixel count in the agv.
But the defaults -r 2 and -t 2 look good.

Example:
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvdenoise | mpeg2enc -o video.m1v
Now we are using yuvdenoise to enhance the image. The filter mainly reduces
color- and luminance-noise and flickering due to phase errors.

Example:
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvkineco -F 4 -S | mpeg2enc -o video.m1v
yuvkineco ist used for NTSC sources. The -F 4 flag sets yuvkineco to autodedect
the framreate. With -S you can use an other threshold than the default. It can 
also do the conversation from 29.97 fps to 23.97fps. yuvkineco does only 
remove NTSC specific problems. So if you want to enhance the image you should 
also use yuvdenoise:
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvkineco | yuvdenoise | mpeg2enc -o video.m1v 

Example: 
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvycsnoise | mpeg2enc -o video.m1v
yuvycsnoise is also used for NTSC and is specialized for NTSC Y/C separation 
noise. If video capture hardware has only a poor Y/C separator,at vertical 
stripe (especialy red/blue), noises appear which seem checker flag and 
bright/dark invert per 1 frame. yuvycsnoise reduces noises of this type.
You can also use different thresholds for luma/chroma, and the optimizing 
method. 

PUTTING THE STREAMS TOGETHER
=====================================
Example:
>mplex sound.mp2 video.m1v -o my_video.mpg

Puts the sound.mp2 and the video.m1v stream together to my_video.mpg

Example:
>mplex -S 1500 sound.mp2 video.m1v -o my_film.mpg

Puts the sound.mp2 and video.m1v together, but the file size can be up to 1,5GB
before an second file is created. (default is 680MB)

Note that it does *not* generate seperate stand-alone MPEG streams in each file.
This would in involve ensuring each sequence started with sequence headers and
recalculating buffers and timestamps.
What currently happens is that 2nd 3rd etc files are simply *continuations* of
the 1st.  To play them you need to concatenate them and treat them as a single
looong stream. This is exactly the same (nasty) approach used on DVD's with
their 1G-byte "VOB" files.

Now you can use your prefered MPEG player, and watch it.
All players based on the SMPG library work well.
Other Players are: xtheater, xmovie, xine, gtv for example.

Note: If you have specfied the -S option for mpeg2enc mplex will 
automatically split the files if there is in the output filename a %d (looks 
like: -o test%d.mpg) 
The files generated this way are sepereate stand-alone MPEG steams!

Note: xine might have a problem with seeking through videos.

Variable bit-rate multiplexing:
Remember to tell mplex you're encoding VBR (-V option) as well as mpeg2enc
(see the example scripts).  It *could* auto-detect but it is not working yet.
You should tell mplex a video buffer size at least as large as the one you
specified to "mpeg2enc".  Sensible numbers for MPEG-1 might be a ceiling bit-
rate of 2800Kbps, a quality ceiling (quantisation floor) of 6 and a buffer size
of 400K.

Example:
> mplex -V -r 1740 audio.mp2 video_vbr.m1v -o vbr_stream.mpg

Here we multiplex an variabel bitrate stream. mplex is now a single pass 
multiplexer so it can't dedect the maximal bitrate and we have to specify it.
The data rate for the output stream is, audio bitrate plus peak videobitrate
than add 1-2% for mplex information. If audio (-b 224) has 224kBit, video was
encodet with -b 1500 -q 9 has 1500kBit, we have 1724 * 1.01 is about 1740kBit.

Playing the video:
>plaympeg my_video.mpg
or
>gtv my_video.mpg



TRANSCODING OF EXISTING MPEG-2 STREAMS
=====================================
For transcoding existing MPEG-2 streams from digital TV cards or DVD a still
lower data-rate than for broadcast will give good results. Standard VCD 1152
Kbps typically works just fine for MPEG1. The difference is in the Signal/Noise
ratio of the original.  The noise in the analog stuff makes it much harder to
compress.

You will also need to manually adjust the audio delay offset relative to video
when multiplexing.  Very often around 150ms delay seems to do the trick.

You have to download the ac3dec and mpeg2dec packages. You can find them at
mjpeg hompage (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpeg). You also need sox and
toolame, if you want to use the script.

In the scripts directory there is a trancode script that does most of the work.

So transcoding looks like this:
> transcode -V -o vcd_stream mpeg2src.mpg

-V : set's the options so that a VCD compatible stream is generated
-o vcd_stream : a vcd_stream.m1v (video) and vcd_stream.mp2 (audio) is created
mpeg2src.mpg       : specifies the source stream

The script prints also something like this:
> SYNC 234 mSec

You will need to adjust the audio/video starup delays when multiplexing to
ensure audio and video are synchronised.
The exact delay (in milliseconds) that you need to pass to mplex to synchronise
audio and video using the "-O" is printed by the extract_ac3 tool labelled
"SYNC" when run with the "-s" flag.

Then you need to multiplex them like this:
> mplex -f 1 -O 234 vcd_stream.mp2 vcd_stream.m1v -o lowrate.mpg

-f 1  : Mux format is VCD
-O 234: Offset of timestamps (video-audio) in mSec, 
        generated by the lavtrans script
vcd_stream.mp2i & vcd_stream.m1v : generated files
lowrate.mpg  : the VCD compatibel output stream

> transcode -S -o svcd_stream mpeg2src.mpg

Here the output format is SVCD (MPEG-2 video).

You have to multiplex it with:
> mplex -f 4 -O 234 svcd_stream.mp2 svcd_stream.m2v -o lowrate.mpg

There is sometimes a problem with NTSC and VCD playback because movies may be
recoded with 3:2 pulldown NTSC with 60 fields/sec. mpeg2dec is designed for
playback on computers, and generates the original 24frames/sec bitrate. If you
encode the video now, an 30frames/sec video is created. This video is now much
to short for the encoded audio.

There encoding works now but you have to do it manual:
> cat mpeg2src.mpg | mpeg2dec -s YUVs | buffer -b 4M | \
> mpeg2enc -I 0 -f 4 -q 9 -V 200 -b 2500 -F 1 -p -o svcd_stream.m2v

The -F 1 options tells mpeg2enc the frame rate for the endoded video has to
be 24000.0/1001.0 (NTSC 3:2 pulldown converted FILM). The -p tells mpeg2enc
to generate header flags for 3:2 pull down of 24fps movie. It may also work if
you do not add the -p flag. 

You do not need the -p flag because it is not supported in mpeg1.

If you want to do every step on your own it has to look like this:

Extracting Audio: 
> cat test2.mpg | extract_ac3 - -s | ac3dec -o wav -p sound.wav 2>/dev/null

On of the first lines showed contains the label "SYNC" you have to use this 
time afterwards for the multiplexing. The 2>/dev/null redirects the output of
ac3dec to /dev/null. In the next step you generate the mpeg audio file:

> cat sound.wav | mp2enc -V -v 2 -o audio.mp2

-V  : forces VCD format, the sampling rate is converted to 44.1kHz  from 48kHz
-v 2: unnecessary but if you use it mp2enc tells you how many seconds of the
      Audio file are already encoded. 
-o  : Specifies the output file. 

You can generate VCD and SVCD videos, and own mpeg1/2 videos.  

For VCD creation use:

> cat test2.mpg | mpeg2dec -s -o YUVh | buffer -b 4M | \
> mpeg2enc -s -o video_vcd.m1v

mpeg2dec:
-s     : tells mpeg2dec to use program stream demultiplexer
-o YUVh: the output size of the extracted frames.

There are other output modes, try "mpeg2dec --help" but the most important here are:
YUV  : is the full image size
YUVs : is SVCD size
YUVh : is VCD size

Mplex with: 
> mplex -f 1 audio.mp2 video_vcd.m1v -o vcd_stream.mpg

-f 1 : generates an VCD stream

For SVCD creation use:
> cat test2.mpg | mpeg2dec -s -o YUVs | buffer -b 4M | \
> mpeg2enc -f 4 -I 0 -q 9 -V 200 -b 2500 -o video_svcd.mpg

-f 4   : Set options for MPEG 2 SVCD
-I 0   : No field pictures, the pictures are not interlaced. 
-q 9   : Quality factor for the stream (VBR Stream)
-V 200 : Target video buffer size in KB
-b 2500: Maximal video bitrate for the VBR stream
-o     : Output file

Mplex with:
> mplex -f 4 -V -r 2755 audio.mp2 video_svcd -o svcd_stream.mpg

-f 4    : generate an SVCD stream
-V      : Multiplex variable bit-rate video
-r 2755 : Specify data rate of output stream in kbit/sec

For other video output formats this might work:
> cat test2.mpg | mpeg2dec -s -o YUV | buffer -b 4M | \
> yuvscaler yuvscaler -O SIZE_320x200 -O NOT_INTERLACED \
> mpeg2enc -o strange_video.m1v

If you want to reedit mpeg streams, this also work, but in a slightly different 
way. For demultiplexing you can use bbdmux, from the bbtools package.  Splits
out either video or audio very cleanly. Look for the linux port at the bottom.
Aviable at: http://members.home.net/beyeler/bbmpeg.html

First run:
> bbdmux myvideo.mpg

You should get something like this:
Found stream id 0xE0  = Video Stream 0
Found stream id 0xC0  = MPEG Audio Stream 0
Found stream id 0xBE  = Padding Stream

Extract audio with:
> bbdmux myvideo.mpg 0xC0 audio.mp1

Convert it to wav:
> mpg123 -w audio.wav audio.m1v 

Extract video with:
> bbdmux myvideo.mpg 0xE0 video.m1v 

Converting video to an mjpeg avi stream:
> cat video.m1v | mpeg2dec -o YUV | yuv2lav -f a -o test.avi

Then adding the sound to the avi:
> lavaddwav test.avi audio.wav final.avi

If the source video has already the size of the target video use -o YUV, using 
YUVh, makes the video the half size !!

The rest can be done just like editing and encoding other streams. 

If you have videos with ac3 sound you only have to adapt the commands aboth.

Extracting Audio:
> cat test2.mpg | extract_ac3 - -s | ac3dec -o wav -p sound.wav 2>/dev/null

Extract video:
> cat test2.mpg | mpeg2dec -s -o YUVh | buffer -b 4M | \
> yuv2lav -f a -q 85 -o test.avi 
 
Adding the sound:
> lavaddwav test.avi sound.wav fullvideo.avi 

NOTE: You need much space.1GB of video has afterward a size of about 2GB at SVCD
size. Plus some temp files. Converting the Video the mjpeg also takes some time. 
On my Athlon 500 I never get more than 6-7 Frames a second. 
You loose quality each time you convert a stream into a other format !

TRADING QUALITY/SPEED
=====================================
If absolute quality is your objective a modest improvement can be archieved
using the -4 and -2 flags. These control how ruthlessly mpeg2enc discards
bad-looking matches between sections of adjacent frames during the early
stages of the search when it is working with 4*4 and 2*2 clusters of pixels
rather than individual pixels. Setting -4 1 -2 1 maximises quality.  -4 4
-2 4 maximises speed.  Note that because the statistical criteria mpeg2enc
uses for discarding are usually fairly reliable the increase/decrease in
quality is fairly marginal.

Reducing the radius of the search for matching sections of images also
increases speed.  However, due to the way the search algorithm works the
search radius is in effect rounded to the nearest multiple of 8. Furthermore,
on modern CPU's the speed gained by reducing the radius below 16 is not so
huge that the very marked quality reduction is likely to be worthwhile for
most applications.

Creating streams to be played from disk using Software players

Usually MPEG player software is much more flexible than the hardware built into
DVD and VCD players.  This flexibility allows for significantly better
compression to be achieve for the same quality.
The trick is to generate video streams that use big video buffers (500KB or
more) and variable bit-rate encoding (the -q flag to mpeg2enc and -V for
mplex).  Software players will often also correctly player the much more
efficient MPEG layer 3 (yes, "MP3") audio format. A good Mp3 encoder like
lame will produce results comparable to layer 2 at 224Kbps at 128Kbps or
160Kbps.



CREATING VIDEO-CD'S
=====================================
There are some limitations on VCD's
Like bitrate for video 1152kBit and for audio 224kBit.
For audio use:
> lav2wav stream.avi | mp2enc -v -o sound.mp2

-v force VCD compatible output (same as: -b 224 -r 44100 -s)
For hardware players, you should stick to 44.1 224kBps Stereo layer 2 Audio.

For the video use:
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvscaler -O VCD | mpeg2enc -f 1 -r 16 -o video.m1v

For an VCD compatibel output the -f 1 sets all options in mpeg2enc as
needed. Never try for VCD -m or -b. It seems that many VCD players (Avex
for example) are not able to play MPEG streams that are encoded with an search
radius greater than 16. But -r 16 workes fine.

Mplex with:
> mplex -f 1 sound.mp2 video.m1v -o vcd_out.mpg

The -f 1 option turns on a lot of weird stuff that otherwise has no place
in a respectable multiplexer!

Creating the CD:
The multiplexed stream has to be converted to an VCD combatible.
This ist done by vcdimager (Aviable from freshmeat)

Example:
> vcdimager testvideo.mpg

Creates an videocd.bin, the data file, an a videocd.cue which is used as
controllfile for cdcdao.

In Linux you can use cdrdao to burn the image.
Aviable at: http://www.ping.de/sites/daneb/cdrdao.html

For MPEG-1 encoding a typical (45 minute running time) show or 90 odd
minute movie from an analog broadcast a constant bit-rate of around 1800
to be ideal.  The resulting files are around 700M for 45 minutes which
fits nicely as a raw XA MODE2 data track on a CD-R.

For pure digital sources (DTV or DVD streams and similar) VCD 1152 works
fine.

Note: If you encode VBR MPEG1 (-q) remember the Hardware was not bulit do 
the playback because it is not in the specifications. If it works be very
happy. I've notices that it helps when you have an MPEG1 Stream to tell
vcdimager that it ist an svcd. vcdimager complains, but you should be able
to burn it. This could convince the player to use a other firmware an play
it back correct, but there is no guarantie for that. 

Storing MPEG's.
If you record the data as XA mode 2 tracks you can fit appreciably more
on a CD (at the expense of error correction/detection).  You can use
vcdimager to do this and readvcd to extract the resulting files.

For better Quality there are SVCD and XVCD and DVD.
Currently only SVCD is fully supported with a pre-set format in mplex
and tools to create disks. MPEG streams that can be played by DVD player
hardware and software can readily produced using mpeg2enc/mplex but there
is currently no means to make a properly structured disk image. 

If your player doesn't support SVCD however, you may well find it can
handle VCD streams that have much higher than standard bit-rates.Often
as much as 2500kBit/sec is possible.  With higher bit-rates and good
quality source material it is worth trying mpeg2enc's -h flag which
produce a stream that is as sharp as the limits of the VCD standard
permits. The -h flag seems to help also if there is a low quality stream, 
the video does not look that sharp using the flag, but there are not that 
much gitches as without it. 

However, if your player supports it and you have the patience for the
much longer encoding times SVCD is a much better alternative.  Using
a more efficient MPEG format SVCD more than doubles VCD's resolution
whilst typically producing files that are rather less than twice as
big.



CREATING SVCD'S
=====================================
Record at full TV resolution (means: -d 1  for PAL this is 720x568)

Convert the sound with:
> lav2wav stream.avi | mp2enc -v -o sound.mp2

Convert the video with:
> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvscaler -O SVCD | 
> \ mpeg2enc -f 4 -I 3 -b 2500 -v 400 -o video.m2v

-f 4 sets the options for mpeg2enc to SVCD.
-I 3 tell mpeg2enc to assume that the original signal is field interlaced
video where the odd rows of pixels are sampled a half frame interval after
the even ones in each frame. The -I 0 (progressive output (no field
pictures)) option will also work for PAL.
-I 1 and -I 2 will work but are currently handicapped by rather dumb
code to choose the type of motion compensation.

You can use lower bitrates, but the SVCD standard limits total bit-rate
(audio and video) to 2788800 Bit/sec. So with 224Kbps audio and overheads
2550 may already be marginally too tight.

An other possibility for movies in PAL (European style 25 frames/50 fields
per sec) video is:

> lav2yuv stream.avi | yuvscaler -O SVCD | \
> mpeg2enc -f 4 -I 0 -b 2500 -V 400 -o video.m2v

Movies are shot on film at 24 frames/sec.  For PAL broadcast the film is
simply shown slightly "too fast" at 25 frame/sec (much to the pain of people
with an absolute pitch sense of pitch).  The -I 0 flag turns off the tedious
calculations needed to compensate for field interlacing giving much faster
encoding.

Unfortunately, movies broadcast in NTSC (US style 30 frames/60 fields sec)
video this will produce very poor compression.  The "pulldown" sampling
used to produce 60 fields a second from a 24 frame a second movie means
half the frames in an NTSC *are* field interlaced.

For SVCD-encoding, you can of course also use yuvscaler for the downscaling
rather than letting lav2yuv doing that.

Multiplex with:
 
> mplex -f 4 sound.mp2 video.m2v -o vcd_out.mpg

Creating the CD:

Example:
> vcdimager -t svcd testvideo.mpg

Creates an videocd.bin, the data file, an a videocd.cue which is used as
controllfile for cdcdao.

In Linux use cdrdao to burn the image.

Note: The VCD SVCD stuff may work on your HW player or not. There are
many reports that it works quite well. Don't be woried if it does not
work. Nor am I responsible for unusable CDs.



INTEROPERABILITY
=====================================
Quicktime files capturing using lavrec can be editted using Broadcast2000.
mjpeg AVI files captured using the streamer tool from the xawtv package
can be editted and compressed and played back using software.  Hardware
playback is not possible for such files due to limitations in the Zoran
hardware currently supported.

MPEG files produced using the tools are know to play back correctly on:
dxr2 (hardware decoder card)
mtv
ztheater
xine
oms
dvdview
xmovie
MS Media player version 6 and 7
gtv
