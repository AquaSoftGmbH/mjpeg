Additional Notes on compilation and installation

SSE/MMX Support

If you have a basic MMX CPU compile for "MMX" and uncommment the "MMX"
lines in the Makefile.  If you have an Athlon or P-III or better
compile for SSE and uncomment the "SSE" lines in the Makefile.

For the details why: see README

Note that the .o files for MMX and SSE are included as well
as the assembly language source.  This should save those who can't
be bothered the job of installing nasm. The files are tiny...
