Some notes on the maths of Quantization...


(1) The importance of precision...

Its not just quantizing "about right" that matters.

However, mp1e has a very very good idea:  why not precompile a 
combined quantisation / fdct matrix with the multipliers set up
"just right" to include the necessary frig factors.  If nothing
else it saves accumulating numeric errors in the intermediate
results of the coefficients!

That mp1e guy was *smart*...

(2)

If you want to accurately compute an ineteger division using 
multiplication...


Notation:  [x](k)  means x floor-ed to nearest k.  [x] is [x] to the nearest
unit.


[x / d](1)  = [Kx/d](K) = [ [K/d]x +(K%d)x/d ](K) / K

Observe that for large K >> d  [K/d]x >> (K%d)x/d
so that the (K%d)x/d is in effect a rounding correction
and hence need not itself be desperately accurate.  Thus we
expand another step to obtain...

           = [[K/d]x  + [(K%d)[K/d]x + d](K)/K ](K) /K

Where d is a very small correction factor. We now observe that
since we're flooring to K on the outside we're really on interested
in whether the rounding factor generates a "carry" so it doesn't
need to be 100% accurate.

		  = [[K/d]x ](K)/K + [[K/d]x]%K + (K%d)[K/d]x + d](K)/K

For K twice word size the first term is simply the high word
of the product [K/d]x 

The second term is simply the low word of the product [K/d]x
plus the term (K%d)[K/d]x + d which for large K and small d will
fit into a single word.  Thus the carry can at most be a single
bit. 

We can compute it "exactly" adding a small fixed round up d (32
appears to work nicely for K=2^16) and d < 256).  However, for MPEG
applications we have fairly limited range of d and x.  For these we
can get "almost" right results with a (coarse approximation).  We know
0 <= K%d < d.  We also know the factor gets very small for larger
d.  Thus we really only need a correction that "works" for small d.
Taking a wild guess to try x ~= (K%d)[K/d]x for smallish d.


Miracle of miracles it works just great!  No too-lows,
and only very rare too highs for large x.

Thus [x/d] ~= hiword([K/d]x) + (loword([K/d]x)+x) >= K )

Clever eh.  The actual computation we quantize in MPEG is

[coefficient[i]*32 + quantisation/2) / quantisation*2*coeffquant[i] ]

So, combining with Mr mp1e's sneakiness what we need is a table of
[K/quantisation*2*coeffquant[i]] for each quantisation.  Ooooerrr...

If we want to get *really* clever we combine the quantisation with the
DCT coefficients to go yet faster.... 


(3) Predicting motion vectors....


You'd think you could use the motion vectors from the P frame as an
upper bound for the those needed in the following (in encoding order)
B-frames.   Wrrrrrooooong.  Doesn't work. Well, actually it works,
but:

(a) The gains ain't impressive (10% maybe).
(b) The is some quality loss.
(c) It is well night impossible to get *any* gains in the MPEG-2
interlaced (field MC case) which is where you'd really want the speed gains.
