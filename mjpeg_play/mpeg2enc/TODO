1.  Fix field sequence MC/prediction. Something broken there...
	
	
2.	Get MMX routines written fast_motion_data.

3	Sort out that wretched vbv verification code.

	The code for scene-change gop sizing and ending sequences can in
	some circumstances mess up as the sizing takes no account of
	the fact the when a sequence split occurs the I-frame tempref is
	0 not M-1.

4. The horribly muddled file-naming and function naming conventions
	*really* need to be 	made consistent. _MMX _MMXE and
	_mmx.s _mmxe.s...

	The mblockq_ sub-routines intended specification should be documented...

5.	Code Hygiene...
	Is all the 	block_count dependant code is o.k. for YUV422 and YUV444?

	The order of return from block_dist1_MMXE is silly.  Why not
	retun in the order it is held and adjust find_best_one_pel_MMXE to
	suit.  

	The rate control code is now a mess of int64_t , double and int. Needs
	tidying...

	The setting of encoding parameters from cmd line flags is a mess
	and needs seriously working through.  There ought to be a flag
	for selecting frame_pred_dct for progressive mpeg-2 sequences.

	There's lots of redundant copying around of parameters to/from
	records in putseq and some in parts of motion.c.

	The P-field of a interlaced sequence I-frame needs its own
	motion vector ranges and f-codes.

	The field/frame encoding sequence in putseq could be packaged into its
	own function.

6. What the hell was BITCOUNT_OFFSET for?  Probably a debugger that needs purging.
