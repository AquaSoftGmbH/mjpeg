Short Term

1.	Tidy up defaults for gop sizes etc for NTSC vs. PAL

2.	The order of return from block_dist1_MMXE is silly.  Why not
	retune in the order it is held and adjust find_best_one_pel_MMXE to
	suit.  

3.	The rate control code is now a mess of int64_t , double and int. Needs
	tidying...


4.	The code for scene-change gop sizing and ending sequences can in
	some circumstances mess up as the sizing takes no account of
	the fact the when a sequence split occurs the I-frame tempref is
	0 not M-1.


Medium Term

0.	Librarify for gstreamer


/1.  	Bring field sequence MC/prediction to same level as progressive	
	sequence.
	
2.	Improve locality of reference by motion-estimating entire 4x4, 2x2, 1x1
phases in a single pass rather doing each for each Macroblock.

3.  Check out using dist2 for initial MC calculations as well as final
	selection?

4.  Decouple motion estimation and encoding passes to allow backup-and-retry
	and two-pass encoding.

5.	Add low-passing for high-activity regions when a specified quantisation
	level is exceeded (or block boundary edge energy exceeds some threshold?).

6.	Sort out that wretched vbv verification code.

	The mblockq_ sub-routines intended specification should be documented...

7.	Code Hygiene...
	Is all theblock_count dependant code is o.k. for YUV422 and YUV444?
