Short Term

1.	Tidy up defaults for gop sizes etc for NTSC vs. PAL

2.	Librarify for gstreamer

Medium Term


1.  	Bring field sequence MC/prediction to same level as progressive	
	sequence.
	
2.	Get MMX routines written fast_motion_data.

3.  Check out using dist2 for initial MC calculations as well as final
	selection?

4.	Sort out that wretched vbv verification code.

	The code for scene-change gop sizing and ending sequences can in
	some circumstances mess up as the sizing takes no account of
	the fact the when a sequence split occurs the I-frame tempref is
	0 not M-1.

	The mblockq_ sub-routines intended specification should be documented...

5.	Code Hygiene...
	Is all theblock_count dependant code is o.k. for YUV422 and YUV444?

	The order of return from block_dist1_MMXE is silly.  Why not
	retun in the order it is held and adjust find_best_one_pel_MMXE to
	suit.  

	The rate control code is now a mess of int64_t , double and int. Needs
	tidying...
