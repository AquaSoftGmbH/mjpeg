MODIFICATIONS TO ORIGINAL

July 2000 Andrew Stevens
	 Trivial modifications to support catenated audio stremas and
	  non-intractive use.
August 2000 Andrew Stevens
	Modifed to support multiplexing of variable bit-rate
	video streams. Seems to work well.
August 2000 Andrew Stevens
	Removed use of temporary files for storing stream data.
	Increased performance through the use of a more efficient bitstream library.
	Eliminated arithmetic overflow errors for large streams.

Usage: ./mplex [params] [<input stream1> [<input stream2>] <output system stream
>
                                                                                  where possible params are:
 -q      Quiet mode for unattended batch usage
 -n      Noisy mode for debugging multiplexing.
 -V      Variable bit-rate multiplexing.  
 -i      Interactive mode for user intervention
 -b num  Specify decoder buffers size in kB. (default: 46) [ 20...1000]
 -r num  Specify data rate of output stream in kbit/sec (default 0=Compute from
source streams)
 -v num  Specify a video timestamp offset in mSec
 -a num  Specify an audio timestamp offset in mSec
 -s num  Specify sector size in bytes (default: 2324) [256..16384]

Defaults all correspond to VCD data streams.



This is the README file of the MPEG multiplexer 'mplex'.
Besides this file, you should now own a copy of the following files:

  COPYING		the GNU General Public License
  Makefile              a makefile

and the source files

  inits.c         
  interact.c   
  multplex.c     
  timecode.c
  buffer.c        
  inptstrm.c   
  main.c          
  systems.c

  main.h


  bitstrm.c		quick cut from the common.c file from
			the MPEG/audio software simulation group
			and the bit_stream.c package by
			Jean-Georges Fritsch, C-Cube Microsystems

  bitstrm.h		quick cut from the common.h file from
			the MPEG/audio software simulation group
			and the bit_stream.c package by
			Jean-Georges Fritsch, C-Cube Microsystems


  bitstrm.c and bitstrm.h are excerpts from the source files
  common.c and common.h by the MPEG/audio software simulation group
  as found in their MPEG/audio (de)coding software package on many
  FTP servers, for example in the IUMA directory of sunsite.unc.edu.
