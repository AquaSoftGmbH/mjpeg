TODO

- Tidy up the timecode code... (now only need to strip to old #ifdef-ed stuff

- Make VBR more efficient.

- Need to get rid of crappy code that hard-wires sizes at top leve rather than
  deriving them from included headers when sectors are created...

- Need to add facility to drop sys headers

- The checking for VBV underflow/overflow is horribly naive.  The messages are essentially
	meaningless in typical use of the encoder where the results are later multiplexed
	into a system stream.

- Tidy up the #ifdef Spaghetti around the removal of temporary files.

- Merge in stuff to deal with MPEG2 from bbmpeg

- Merge in stuff to deal with VCD/DVD's additional bits and pieces
  from bbmpeg.
