TODO

- Complete tidying up the systems.cc structure.   Non-duplication of the
	header generation stuff would be neat if it can be managed...

- Start testing the AC3/DVD muxing stuff.  I reckommend AC3 first, then
	DVD.

- Currently the VCD HR Stills muxing stuff assumes *all* HR stills
  are the same size which is given in the initial vbv_buffer_size...
	This will work with mpeg2enc (which does this) but will fail fail fail
	with other streams.

- Rebuild initial delay / sequence splitting DTS adjustment stuff so
	different streams can have different starting delays based on
	*stream* parameters.  I.e. delay should be delegated to the elementary
	streams with only a sector_prefix offset set centrally.

- Tidy code so Elementary streams handle their mux parameter initialisation
	from cmd-line parameters *not* the output stream.

- Add checking for changed sequence parameters in mid-sequence sequence headers.

- Add basic DVD support ( needs predecessor really).
	Note the bizarre absence of PTS/DTS except on I-frames.


- Make VBR more efficient.


Eventually:

- Full SVCD (MPEG audio extension) support.
