TODO

- Rebuild initial delay / sequence splitting DTS adjustment stuff so
	different streams can have different starting delays based on
	*stream* parameters.  I.e. delay should be delegated to the elementary
	streams with only a sector_prefix offset set centrally.

- Add basic DVD support ( needs predecessor really).


- Make VBR more efficient.


Eventually:

- Full SVCD (MPEG audio extension) support.
