	Friday 13th ... no comment -- Initial CVS release.

14.7.2001
	Arghhh,... I should have wait a day. Everything was going wrong
	and even went worse when I tried to fix it. In detail: I fixed
	several Bugs in the Motion-Compensation. The most ugly bug was
	*not* to use the reference frame but a subsampled one in the
	full-pel search ... uhhhh ... That was bad ...

	Several bugs in the block-copy-routines fixed (eg. that neat thing
	overwriting a correct neighbor-block...)

	Introduced a totally different method of deciding weather a block
	is good or bad ... still need a better method here ! At least it
	seems to work, now.

15.7.2001
	Changed search to 8x8 blocks. (Not really. The search itself
	remained (for the subsampled passes) at 16x16 and only 8x8 is used
	for pel and half-pel search as well as for matching against the
	SQD mean values. One odd thing is this seems to produces less
	misdetected blocks the other is: *IF* we have visible blocks
	they're of the same nature I have seen in MPEG4/DivX ... 
	Despite that it seems to work much better (and much slower).
	Music keeps me alive ... Thanks to "Das Ich". and to "Jacobs Dröh-
	nung"
