	Friday 13th ... no comment -- Intitial CVS release.

14.7.2001
	Arghhh,... I should have wait a day. Everything was going wrong
	and even went worse when I tried to fix it. In detail: I fixed
	several Bugs in the Motion-Compensation. The most ugly bug was
	*not* to use the reference frame but a subsampled one in the
	full-pel search ... uhhhh ... That was bad ...

	Several bugs in the block-copy-routines fixed (eg. that neat thing
	overwriting a correct neighbour-block...)

	Introduced a totaly different method of decideing weather a block
	is good or bad ... still need a better method here ! At least it
	seems to work, now.
