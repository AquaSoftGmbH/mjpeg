***** 

This is a Quicktime library for UNIX in a freely redistributable,
statically linkable library.  You can statically link it in a program
and charge money for the program.  The only condition is that if you
use it in a program, you must put the author's name and email
somewhere.  If you improve the library itself or add a free codec to
it, you should release your improvements.  If you redistribute the
code, you must also redistribute the author information and
documentation.  At this time it's very popular to license stuff under
the GPL.  You are free to include this library in a derived work and
license the derived work under GPL.

*****
