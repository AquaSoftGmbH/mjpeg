<H1>Firewire information</H1>

Since grabbing from a firewire camcorder and decoding DV frames are as
heavily integrated as they are, the firewire system was integrated in
Quicktime for Linux.  When you build Quicktime for Linux you also build
firewire and DV libraries, all statically linked into libquicktime.a.<P>

The firewire interface is defined in <B>libdv/libdv.h</B>.<P>

Libdv defines two objects: the <B>dv_t</B> object and the
<B>dv_grabber_t</B> object.<P>

<H1>The dv_grabber_t object</H1>

It allows you to grab frames from a camcorder without decompression.<P>

1) Grabs DV frames from a firewire device, determines the size of each
frame, and hence the conformance.<P>

<B>Step 1:</B><P>

#include "libdv.h" and create a new grabber object.  Only one instance of
dv_grabber_t may exist in an executable.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_grabber_t *grabber = dv_grabber_new();<P>
</CODE>

<B>Step 2:</B><P>

Start the grabber reading in the background.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_start_grabbing(grabber, firewire_port, firewire_channel, buffers);<P>
</CODE>

The grabber reads frames continuously until buffers number of buffers
have been filled, then waits until a buffer becomes available before
continuing to read.  While it's reading you can call<P>

<CODE>
	dv_grab_frame(grabber, &frame, &size);<P>
</CODE>

to grab a frame.  This points unsigned char *frame to a buffer and long
size to the size of the buffer.  You must now either write the frame to
disk or decode it in a dv_t object.  The size value is synonymous with
the dimensions of the frame.  A size of 120000 is an NTSC frame and
hence 720x480.  A size of 140000 is a PAL frame and hence 720x576.<P>

After you're done with the buffer call<P>

<CODE>
	dv_unlock_frame(grabber);<P>
</CODE>

to allow the grabber to continue grabbing into the buffer you just read.<P>

<B>Step 3:</B><P>

When you're finished grabbing call<P>

<CODE>
	dv_stop_grabbing(grabber);<P>
</CODE>

to stop the background process.  Follow this with<P>

<CODE>
	dv_grabber_delete(grabber);<P>
</CODE>

to delete the grabber object.<P>

<B>Step 4:</B><P>

Incidentally, the Linux firewire interface has no hot swapping.  If you
disconnect a firewire device or turn it off while grabbing the grabber
will lock up.  The solution to Linux firewire is the following.  <P>

If<P>

<CODE>
	dv_grabber_crashed(grabber);<P>
</CODE>

returns 1 you need to override the kernel with <P>

<CODE>
	dv_interrupt_grabber(grabber);<P>
</CODE>

before stopping the grabber with<P>

<CODE>
	dv_stop_grabbing(grabber);<P>
	dv_grabber_delete(grabber);<P>
</CODE>



<H1>The dv_t object</H1>

It allows you to decompress DV frames.<P>

1) Decodes video data from a DV frame<BR>
2) Decodes audio data from a DV frame<P>

DV stores audio and video in each frame.  You can either read DV frames
produced by the dv_grabber_t object or from an arbitrary file.  The
dv_t object merely needs an input data buffer and a buffer size.  Both
dv_t and dv_grabber_t objects should exist at the same time if you want to decode frames
simultaneous with grabbing.<P>

<B>Step 1:</B><P>

#include "libdv.h" and create a new dv decoder.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_t *dv = dv_new();<P>
</CODE>

<B>Step 2:</B><P>

Read a video frame from a buffer.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_read_video(dv, rgb_rows, buffer, size, color_model);<P>
</CODE>

dv is the dv decoding object.<P>

rgb_rows is an array of pointers, one pointer to each row of an output
frame.  Each row must have enough memory allocated to store a row of
the specified color model.  The dimensions of the frame must be
determined by whatever procedure grabs the data from the device.<P>

buffer is the compressed data.<P>

size is the size of the compressed data.  This can be the size value
returned by dv_grab_frame or a #define from libdv.h.<P>

color_model is the color model to generate.  Currently it can only be
DV_RGB888.<P>

<B>Step 3:</B><P>

Read audio frames.  This procedure only works for 2 channel 16 bit
encoding in the DV frame.  Call dv_read_audio for each frame to extract
the audio from.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_read_audio(dv, samples, data, size);<P>
</CODE>

dv is the dv pointer.  Samples is a preallocated buffer of 4096 bytes. 
Data is the compressed DV frame.  Size is the number of bytes in the DV
frame.<P>

This function returns the number of 16 bit twos complement samples
deposited in *samples.<P>

<B>Step 4:</B><P>

Delete the dv object when finished reading frames.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_delete(dv);<P>
</CODE>
