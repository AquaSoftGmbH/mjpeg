	* Moved to macroblock at a time color conversion, based on the work
 	  of Scott F. Johnston <scott@fleetingimage.com>.  I rewrote his
 	  shuffle code.  Partly so I could understand it better (I added
 	  lots of comments), and also I did the PAL version too.  I decided
 	  to leave mapping between dif blocks/segments and superblock
 	  row/columns to the parse code.  I took his block at a time ycrcb
 	  conversion directly, except for making clamp_y lookup based.

	* New idct code for 2-4-8.  It's an integer version, based on an
 	approach like that of the AAN algorithm.  Next step will be to MMX
 	it.

	* place.c: Fixes to 4:2:0 placement.  Color resembles something
 	like correct now. :}

	* Add initial macroblock placement for 4:2:0 (IEC61834).  Initial
 	  test shows luma is OK, but color isn't working correctly.

	* Added rudimentary PAL decoding, as well as a way to
 	  differentiate between IEC61834 and SMPTE314M video, which is
 	  critical for dealing with PAL data.
