  but that path doesn't exist
* removed the last pointers to 1.4.x versions 
* fixed a error for the LAV* env variables
* some GList related preferences save bugfixes
* bugfixes where the extension of a file (.mp2, .m1v) precedes the filename,

Updates from 0.1.5 to 0.1.6
---------------------------

* Changed the saving of the encoding options. 
* Updated som options in the encoding part because they were changed in the 
  mjpeg tools, some shown options do not work in every version !!!
* Added the yuv2lav encoding part (a better name would be fine too)
* Added the aviable interlacing correction options to the input field
* A proper error handling for missing/not aviable applications was added
* Distributed encoding support added (means RSH)
* A memory allocation error which totally screwed up the editor was fixed
* pretty many small fixes which allow spaces in filenames
* Script generation was added
* A better support for yuvdenoise was added. You have now the most important
  option to choose from. 
* The support for the mjpeg-tools version 1.4.x was removed. 
* The support for lav2yuv options was also removed.


Updates from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5
---------------------------
* The encoding section has changed a lot, added the support for the 1.5.x 
  version. The 1.4.x version should also work. You can select the encoding 
  syntax version when you set the Syntax style to 1.5.x (default: 1.4.x this 
  option is saved in the config file)
* Because of this the "MPEG level" checkboxes and the button for the "Sequence
  Header for every GOP" have been dismissed. They are now automatical set when 
  you select the mplex format in the "Muliplex format" box.
* The encoding options are only saved when you use the 
  "Save Default Options" button
* There are 4 default sets of options that are predefined, but the options can 
  be changed as needed. They are named as Task: MPEG-1, MPEG2, VCD, SVCD.
* The "Play output/video file" buttons only work when the Output/Video file
  exists. The default player (gtv) can not play back MPEG-2 videos !!!
* The Bicubic scaling does only work if the encoding syntax is 1.5.x
* If you cativate Mux VBR the last entry in the Box "Datarate of Streams"
  is calulated on the acutal values of Audio Bitrate and Video Bitrate.
* The decoder Buffer size has to be correct set up when you encode the video.
  If you set the first time when multiplexing it's to late. The decoder buffer
  size is important for the video encoding too. 
* Might be a good idea not to use "Lav2yuv output format" and the Output window
  the same time. First is scaling with lav2yuv, 2nd is scaling with yuvscaler.
* The "Video / Mux Format" Entries VCD Stills, SVCD Stills, DVD are not tested
* Most entries can be edited as needed. But our own creation is not saved in
  the list of the entry field. After all it is saved as value and shown and 
  used correct. But not in all fields, does not work for example in the:
  "Video / Mux format", "Interlacing correction" "Samplerate"
* Sorry for the spelling mistakes, this text was written by me (Bernhard)
  on a Sunday morning.

Updates from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4
---------------------------
* lavplay works now (removed the floating point error, which was a
   "divide-by-zero" beginner mistake)
* updates the pipes system a bit to give a better-to-understand mode
   in verbose mode (-d)
* fixed the bug where the lavrec part wouldn't show that it was ready
* fixed some minor bugs in lavencode.c
* updated the error handling system which should now actually do something

Updates compared to version 0.1.2a
----------------------------------
Well, I'd better ask what stayed the same.
A lot changed. The recording part is near completion, I think, I really
am starting to like it. The looks may of course change, but the back-engine
works as it's supposed to. It even includes scene recognition.
The editing part is completely new. This has caused a *lot* of changes in
lavplay itself too. You can do simple move, delete, add scenes/frames,
and this is show to the user with scene-images. There's also the option
of 'trimming', so cutting parts of the video off (double click a scene
image and see).
Bernhard Praschinger wrote a wrapper for lav2yuv, mpeg2enc, yuvscaler,
mp2enc, lav2wav and mplex for MPEG-encoding. Should work quite nicely.
