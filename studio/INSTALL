Installation
---------------
You need Gtk to use this application. You also need the MJPEG-Tools  
installed. Besides that, you now also need an X-server with the Xvideo 
extension installed (i.e. you need XFree 4.x). In the XF86Config file, add 
the line 'Load "v4l"' in the modules-section. Next, restart X (you must 
have the zoran drivers loaded before staring X, or the V4L-module won't 
work!). For some distros, you might have to install this module first 
(RedHat 7.0: you need the XFree86-V4L-.... RPM).
 
After that, it's simple:
# ./configure
# make
# make install
 
Then, you can start it up by simply calling "studio" at the prompt. When 
first starting, Studio will grab the first V4L-port it encounters. If 
you're using more than one v4l-card (for example, a bttv-card), it might 
choose the wrong one. You can change this in the Options-window. You 
can also use 'studio -t' (from the command-line) to see which modules/cards
are using which ports and specify the video-for-linux port using 'studio -p
<x>' (in my case, the port number was 49). Studio will save this in the
config file so you only need to do this once.
 
After that, have fun!
