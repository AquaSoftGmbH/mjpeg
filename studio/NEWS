Encode Video Page changes compared wit the last version:

Added the support for the 1.5.x cvs version. The 1.4.x version should also work.
You can select the encoding syntax version when you set the Syntax style 
to 1.5.x (default: 1.4.x this option is saved in the config file) 
Because of this the "MPEG level" checkboxes and the button for the "Sequence
Header for every GOP" have been dismissed. 
They are now automatical set when you select the mplex format in the "Muliplex 
format" box.
