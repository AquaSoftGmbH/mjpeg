                    Linux Video Studio README
================================================================

Introduction
---------------
Linux Video Studio is a small-'n-simple GUI for the MJPEG-tools
(http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/). The MJPEG-tools can be used to record
video from a zoran-based capture card (DC10+, Buz, LML33), playback
video to the same card and encode video to MPEG.
Linux Video Studio tries to extend this with simple editing functions,
like deleting frames, adding frames from new videos, moving frames,
scene detection etc. All this hoping to be useful.

Basically, just install and start the application - you'll see.

A dream/story
----------------
I once started doing this application with a dream about an easy-to-use,
good-looking video editor for linux, maybe like Apple's iMovie.
I've learned a lot and see that Linux Video Studio itself will probably
never fullfill this dream. I hope to start working on a new-generation
video-editing library, based on Gstreamer (http://www.gstreamer.net/).
This should lead to a new video-editor which *should* come closer to my
'dream-video-editor'.

But does that mean this sucks? No, of course not. I've tried to include
the 'basic video-editing-options' in this program.
You can record, playback to hardware, do simple editing and encode the
video to MPEG. Seems like a nice and simple application to me. I hope
I'm not the only one who likes it that way.

Linux Video Studio is still what it wanted to be - a GUI for the MJPEG-
tools. And that's all I really need for now :-).

Credits
----------
Parts of Studio are based on or have been written with the help of:
XawTV, lavtools/MJPEG-tools, bluefish.
Lots of thanks to anyone on all the mailinglists where I posted questions 
(gtk-list@gnome.org, mjpeg-developer@lists.sourceforge.net and 
mjpeg-users@lists.sourceforge.net) that solved problems for me
in some way.
Thanks also to the comp.unix.programmer newsgroup where I learned a lot
about unix programming in general.
Thanks to Gerd Knorr <kraxel@bytesex.org> for the help on the brightness,
saturation etc. sliders in the recording part.

Disclaimer
-------------
If it doesn't work, if it formats your hard disk, if it does something 
it shouldn't do, if you see a bird flying by, don't blame me. This is test 
software in alpa/development state, it can do anything or nothing at all. 
I'd be happy if you reported bugs to me, though :-) (see contacting).
