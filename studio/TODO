Reported bugs:
==============

Short term:
===========
* new lavrec options: channel (just as in stv?)
* stv demutes audio, studio doesn't
* If recording src is changed, auto-update the mixer device/slider (audio)
* Effect-result movies should be used in the editlist (doh)

Long term:
==========
* Make a lavpipe-kind of gstreamer-based video-editor library for
    stream-combining and effects
* Make a preview screen for the image-overlay thingy
    it should support dragging so the user can place the image
    in the image

images:
=======
* scenelist icons for (each of the?) transitions, text/image overlay
* start/stop/init capture (poweron.xpm/poweroff.xpm)
* yes/no/close buttons everywhere

Bernhards Problems:
===================
* never ending: add more options
* split it to more files ??
* add support for yuvmedianfilter
* make the input fields more secure
* make test for the input and output files
* remove beginning mistakes
* make some kind of batch productions 
* write a description for the thing. 
* Long term: make it look better
* Long term: make the task labes editable
* Long term: add lavtrans (works for video already with yuv2lav)
* Long term: support for MPEG audio Layer3 
* Long term: add jpeg2yuv as source
* Very long term: add the transcoding stuff (maybe)
