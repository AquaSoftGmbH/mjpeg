Short term:
===========
* add images to remaining "un-images" buttons (esp. lavencode.c)
    - "power"-button image
    - more :-)
* If recording src is changed, auto-update the mixer device/slider (audio)
* After scene detection, offer to make the newly recorded movie the active 
    one in lavplay, lavedit AND lavencode
* open movie menu-item in the file menu which does the same
* Effect-result movies should be used in the editlist (doh)

Long term:
==========
* Make a lavpipe-kind of gstreamer-based video-editor library for
    stream-combining and effects
* Librarify lavplay (and yuvscaler (Xavier), mpeg2enc and such (Andrew))
* Make a preview screen for the image-overlay thingy
    it should support dragging so the user can place the image
    in the image

Laurens - images:
=================
* Gnome desktop icon
* power button image (on && off)
* for the three effect buttons (text, image, scene transition)
* some encoding buttons?
* effects: color and font

Bernhards Problems:
===================
* add more options
* make option screens for video encoding and mplex
* make the setting of the values file based. 
* split it to more files ??
* make the imput fields more secure
* make test for the input and output files
* remove beginning mistakes
* make some kind of batch productions 
* Very long therm: add the transcoding stuff (maybe)
