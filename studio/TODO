Next Version
==========
* add images to remaining "un-images" buttons (esp. lavencode.c)
    - "power"-button image
    - more :-)
* If recording src is changed, auto-update the mixer device/slider (audio)
* After scene detection, offer to make the newly recorded movie the active 
    one in lavplay, lavedit AND lavencode
* open movie menu-item in the file menu which does the same
* sliders or a label in lavpipe | yuvplay-part (preview) ("frame 0/12")
* change all the " >> /dev/null 2>&1" into if (verbose) NO_OUTPUT and
    #define NO_OUTPUT "..."

Long term:
==========
* rewrite lavpipe to allow searching, runtime loading/editing
    etc. (like lavplay) and use it instead of "lavplay -S"
    (This will probably become uesless once we use gstreamer)
* Once we've >1 scene transition, make a selection box
* Make a preview screen for the image-overlay thingy
    it should support dragging so the user can place the image
    in the image

Bernhards Problems:
====lavencode.c====
* add more options
* make option screens for video encoding and mplex
* make the setting of the values file based. 
* split it to more files ??
* make the imput fields more secure
* make test for the input and output files
* remove beginning mistakes
* make some kind of batch productions 
* Very long therm: add the transcoding stuff (maybe)
