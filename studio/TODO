Reported bugs:
==============
* Encoding syntax style (and probably other encoding options) are
    not saved on exit? This should probably be changed to behave
    just like the rest (save-on-exit).

Short term:
===========
* new lavrec options: channel (just as in stv?)
* add images to remaining "un-images" buttons (esp. lavencode.c)
    - "power"-button image
    - more :-)
* If recording src is changed, auto-update the mixer device/slider (audio)
* Effect-result movies should be used in the editlist (doh)
* Brightness and sound volume sliders in lavplay-page

Long term:
==========
* Make a lavpipe-kind of gstreamer-based video-editor library for
    stream-combining and effects
* Make a preview screen for the image-overlay thingy
    it should support dragging so the user can place the image
    in the image

Laurens - images:
=================
* for the three effect buttons (text, image, scene transition)
* some encoding buttons?
* effects: color and font
* scenelist icons for (each of the?) transitions, text/image overlay

Bernhards Problems:
===================
* never ending: add more options
* split it to more files ??
* add support for yuvdenoise, and mybe yuvmedianfilter
* make the imput fields more secure
* make test for the input and output files
* remove beginning mistakes
* make some kind of batch productions 
* write a description for the thing. 
* Long term: make it look better
* Long term: make the task labes editable
* Long term: add the divx output
* Long term: add lavtrans 
* Long term: support for MPEG audio Layer3 
* Long term: add jpeg2yuv as source
* Very long therm: add the transcoding stuff (maybe)
