thanks to:

* Franz Ackermann, for suffering from my lack of patience and finally surrendering and getting me a CD-i player
* Heiko Eissfeldt, for providing OSS edc/ecc routines
* Rainer Johanni, for creating mkvcdfs, from which I stole a few ideas 

...and finally to all those people who helped with testing VCDImager!
