Introduction
************

   "VCDImager"(1) is a tool for pre-mastering CDROM images suitable for
being burned to CD recordables. It takes MPEG movie files as input and
generates an image file and a cuesheet file which can be fed to any
CD-recording program which understands the BIN/CUE-format, e.g.
cdrdao(2).

Commandline Options
*******************

   There aren't many commandline options at the moment:

     $ vcdimager --help
     Usage: home/hvr/bin/vcdimager [OPTION...]

Example
*******

   In the following example session, the files `track1.mpg',
`track2.mpg' and `track3.mpg' are mastered into the default output
files `videocd.cue' and `videocd.bin'. The volume label is set to `My
Test VCD'.

     $ vcdimager --volume-label="My Test VCD" track{1,2,3}.mpg
     finished ok, image created with 13421 sectors (31566192 bytes)
     $

Requirements For MPEG Files
***************************

   VCDImager expects MPEG streams in a format suitable for VideoCD
production.

   The Video-CD 2.0 specification requires the MPEG-1 stream to have a
maximum bitrate of 1151929.1 bits/sec and to have one of the following
resolution:

   * 352 x 240  29.97 Hz (NTSC)

   * 352 x 240  23.976 Hz (FILM)

   * 352 x 288  25 Hz (PAL)

   Furthermore the MPEG files need to be padded to 2324 byte blocks. So
if VCDImager complains, try fixing those files with VCDpad (3) or any
other program capable of aligning or fixing MPEG blocks.

CD-i Support
************

   The support files needed in order to be able to play Video-CDs on
CD-i players are `cdi_imag.rtf', `cdi_text.fnt' and `cdi_vcd.app'(4).
VCDImager expects them to be in some build-time configured default
directory which may be overidden by the `--cdi-dir=' option. CD-i
support can be disabled with the `--disable-cdi' option if those files
are missing or CD-i support needs to be omitted.
