@unnumbered Introduction

@c fixme add node structure

@dfn{VCDImager}@footnote{see
@url{http://www.hvrlab.dhs.org/~hvr/vcdimager/}} is a
tool for pre-mastering @acronym{CDROM} images suitable for being burned to CD
recordables. It takes @acronym{MPEG} movie files as input and generates
an image file and a cuesheet file which can be fed to any CD-recording
program which understands the BIN/CUE-format, e.g. cdrdao@footnote{see
@url{http://www.ping.de/sites/daneb/cdrdao.html}}.

@c fixme write much more :-)

@unnumbered Commandline Options

@unnumbered Example

In the following example session, the files @file{track1.mpg},
@file{track2.mpg} and @file{track3.mpg} are mastered into the default
output files @file{videocd.cue} and @file{videocd.bin}. The volume label
is set to `My Test VCD'.

@example
@cartouche
$ vcdimager --volume-label="My Test VCD" track@{1,2,3@}.mpg 
finished ok, image created with 13421 sectors (31566192 bytes)
$
@end cartouche
@end example

@unnumbered Requirements For MPEG Files

VCDImager expects @acronym{MPEG} streams in a format suitable for
VideoCD production.

The Video-CD 2.0 specification requires the @acronym{MPEG}-1 stream to
have a maximum bitrate of 1151929.1 bits/sec and to have one of the
following resolution:

@itemize @bullet
@item
352 x 240 @ 29.97 Hz (@acronym{NTSC})
@item
352 x 240 @ 23.976 Hz (@acronym{FILM})
@item
352 x 288 @ 25 Hz (@acronym{PAL})
@end itemize

Furthermore the @acronym{MPEG} files need to be padded to 2324 byte
blocks. So if VCDImager complains, try fixing those files with VCDpad
@footnote{see @url{http://www.nocrew.org/?part=vcdpad}} or any other
program capable of aligning or fixing @acronym{MPEG} blocks.

@unnumbered CD-i Support

The support files needed in order to be able to play Video-CDs on
@acronym{CD-i} players are @file{cdi_imag.rtf}, @file{cdi_text.fnt} and
@file{cdi_vcd.app}@footnote{see @url{http://www.icdia.org/sw_app/}}.
VCDImager expects them to be in some build-time configured default
directory which may be overidden by the @option{--cdi-dir=}
option. @acronym{CD-i} support can be disabled with the
@option{--disable-cdi} option if those files are missing or
@acronym{CD-i} support needs to be omitted.

@bye
