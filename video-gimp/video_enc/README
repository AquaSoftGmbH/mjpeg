gap_encode - The gap encoding facility
======================================

This plugin is used together with GAP (or Gimp Video) to encode
animations into one of the common video formats like QT or AVI,
and into more strange ones like Lokigames' SMJPEG and the buz_tools'
movtar format.

gap_encode is in a very early stage of development, and although it already
produces usable output, it can change shape in any possible way in the
future, and it certainly has a bunch of bugs, too ;) ... but none of the
bugs should be so serious that it crashes your system - however, as usual:
No responsibility for any damage using this software inflicts.

Restrictions:
Very basic sound support, each of the plugins 
only allows import of WAV files.
